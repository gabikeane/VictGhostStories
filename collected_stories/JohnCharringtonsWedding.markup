<story><meta><title>JOHN CHARRINGTON'S WEDDING</title>
    <author>Edith Nesbitt</author></meta> 
    <body><paragraph><plot point="protag"/>No one ever thought that <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May Forster</character> would marry <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John
        Charrington</character>; but he thought differently, and things which <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character> intended had a
        queer way of coming to pass. He asked her to marry him before he went up to Oxford. She
        laughed and refused him. He asked her again next time he came home. Again she laughed,
        tossed her dainty blonde head, and again refused. A third time he asked her; she said it was
        becoming a confirmed bad habit, and laughed at him more than ever.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> was not the only man who wanted to marry her: she was the belle of our village coterie,
        and we were all in love with her more or less; it was a sort of fashion, like heliotrope
        ties or Inverness capes. Therefore we were as much annoyed as surprised when <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John
        Charrington</character> walked into our little local Club—we held it in a loft over the saddler's, I
        remember—and invited us all to his wedding.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="amb"/><speech>Your wedding?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="amb"/><speech>You don't mean it?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="amb"/><speech>Who's the happy fair? When's it to be?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character> filled his pipe and lighted it before he replied. Then he said—</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>I'm sorry to deprive you fellows of your only joke—but <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">Miss Forster</character> and I are to be married
        in September.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="amb"/><speech>You don't mean it?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="amb"/><speech>He's got the mitten again, and it's turned his head.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>No,</speech> I said, rising, <speaker name="narrator"/><speech>I see it's true. Lend me a pistol some one—or a first-class fare to
        the other end of Nowhere. Charrington has bewitched the only pretty girl in our twenty-mile
        radius. Was it mesmerism, or a love-potion, Jack?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>Neither, sir, but a gift you'll never have—perseverance—and the best luck a man ever had in
        this world.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>There was something in his voice that silenced me, and all chaff of the other fellows failed
        to draw him further.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The queer thing about it was that when we congratulated <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">Miss Forster</character>, she blushed and smiled
        and dimpled, for all the world as though she were in love with him, and had been in love
        with him all the time. Upon my word, I think she had. Women are strange creatures.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We were all asked to the wedding. In Brixham every one who was anybody knew everybody else
        who was any one. My sisters were, I truly believe, more interested in the trousseau than the
        bride herself, and I was to be best man. The coming marriage was much canvassed at afternoon
        tea-tables, and at our little Club over the saddler's, and the question was always asked:
        <speaker name="amb"/><speech>Does she care for him?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><plot point="intro"/>I used to ask that question myself in the early days of their engagement, but after a certain
        evening in August I never asked it again. I was coming home from the Club through the
        churchyard. Our church is on a thyme-grown hill, and the turf about it is so thick and soft
        that one's footsteps are noiseless.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I made no sound as I vaulted the low lichened wall, and threaded my way between the
        tombstones. It was at the same instant that I heard <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington's</character> voice, and saw Her.
        <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May</character> was sitting on a low flat gravestone, her face turned towards the full splendour of the
        western sun. Its expression ended, at once and for ever, any question of love for him; it
        was transfigured to a beauty I should not have believed possible, even to that beautiful
        little face.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> lay at her feet, and it was his voice that broke the stillness of the golden August
        evening.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><plot point="history"/><speaker name="john"/><speech>My dear, my dear, I believe I should come back from the dead if you wanted me!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>I coughed at once to indicate my presence, and passed on into the shadow fully
        enlightened.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>The wedding was to be early in September. Two days before I had to run up to town on
        business. The train was late, of course, for we are on the South-Eastern, and as I stood
        grumbling with my watch in my hand, whom should I see but <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character> and <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May Forster</character>.
        They were walking up and down the unfrequented end of the platform, arm in arm, looking into
        each other's eyes, careless of the sympathetic interest of the porters.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Of course I knew better than to hesitate a moment before burying myself in the
        booking-office, and it was not till the train drew up at the platform, that I obtrusively
        passed the pair with my Gladstone, and took the corner in a first-class smoking-carriage. I
        did this with as good an air of not seeing them as I could assume. I pride myself on my
        discretion, but if <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> were travelling alone I wanted his company. I had it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>Hullo, old man,</speech> came his cheery voice as he swung his bag into my carriage; <speaker name="john"/><speech>here's luck; I
        was expecting a dull journey!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Where are you off to?</speech> I asked, discretion still bidding me turn my eyes away, though I saw,
        without looking, that hers were red-rimmed.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>To old <character name="branbridge" gender="m" class="high">Branbridge</character>'s,</speech> he answered, shutting the door and leaning out for a last word with
        his sweetheart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="may"/><speech>Oh, I wish you wouldn't go, <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>,</speech> she was saying in a low, earnest voice. <speaker name="may"/><speech>I feel certain
        something will happen.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>Do you think I should let anything happen to keep me, and the day after to-morrow our
        wedding-day?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="may"/><speech>Don't go,</speech> she answered, with a pleading intensity which would have sent my Gladstone on to
        the platform and me after it. But she wasn't speaking to me. <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character> was made
        differently; he rarely changed his opinions, never his resolutions.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>He only stroked the little ungloved hands that lay on the carriage door.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>I must, <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May</character>. The old boy's been awfully good to me, and now he's dying I must go and see
        him, but I shall come home in time for——</speech> the rest of the parting was lost in a whisper and
        in the rattling lurch of the starting train.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="may"/><speech>You're sure to come?</speech> she spoke as the train moved.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>Nothing shall keep me,</speech> he answered; and we steamed out. After he had seen the last of the
        little figure on the platform he leaned back in his corner and kept silence for a
        minute.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When he spoke it was to explain to me that his godfather, whose heir he was, lay dying at
        Peasmarsh Place, some fifty miles away, and had sent for <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>, and <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> had felt bound to
        go.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>I shall be surely back to-morrow,</speech> he said, <speaker name="john"/><speech>or, if not, the day after, in heaps of time.
        Thank Heaven, one hasn't to get up in the middle of the night to get married nowadays!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>And suppose <character name="branbridge" gender="m" class="high">Mr. Branbridge</character> dies?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>Alive or dead I mean to be married on Thursday!</speech> <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> answered, lighting a cigar and
        unfolding the Times.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>At Peasmarsh station we said <speaker name="john and narrator"/><speech>good-bye,</speech> and he got out, and I saw him ride off; I went on to
        London, where I stayed the night.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>When I got home the next afternoon, a very wet one, by the way, my <character name="fanny" gender="f" class="amb">sister</character> greeted me
        with—</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="sister"/><speech>Where's <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">Mr. Charrington</character>?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Goodness knows,</speech> I answered testily. Every man, since Cain, has resented that kind of
        question.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="sister"/><speech>I thought you might have heard from him,</speech> she went on, <speaker name="fanny"/><speech>as you're to give him away
        to-morrow.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Isn't he back?</speech> I asked, for I had confidently expected to find him at home.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="fanny"/><speech>No, <character name="narrator" gender="m" class="amb">Geoffrey</character>,</speech>—my <character name="fanny" gender="f" class="amb">sister</character>Fanny always had a way of jumping to conclusions, especially such
        conclusions as were least favourable to her fellow-creatures—<speaker name="fanny"/><speech>he has not returned, and, what
        is more, you may depend upon it he won't. You mark my words, there'll be no wedding
        to-morrow.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>My sister Fanny has a power of annoying me which no other human being possesses.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>You mark my words,</speech> I retorted with asperity, <speaker name="narrator"/><speech>you had better give up making such a
        thundering idiot of yourself. There'll be more wedding to-morrow than ever you'll take the
        first part in.</speech> A prophecy which, by the way, came true.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But though I could snarl confidently to my sister, I did not feel so comfortable when, late
        that night, I, standing on the doorstep of <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>'s house, heard that he had not returned. I
        went home gloomily through the rain. Next morning brought a brilliant blue sky, gold sun,
        and all such softness of air and beauty of cloud as go to make up a perfect day. I woke with
        a vague feeling of having gone to bed anxious, and of being rather averse to facing that
        anxiety in the light of full wakefulness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But with my shaving-water came a note from <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> which relieved my mind and sent me up to the
        Forsters' with a light heart.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May</character> was in the garden. I saw her blue gown through the hollyhocks as the lodge gates swung to
        behind me. So I did not go up to the house, but turned aside down the turfed path.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="may"/><speech>He's written to you too,</speech> she said, without preliminary greeting, when I reached her
        side.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Yes, I'm to meet him at the station at three, and come straight on to the church.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>Her face looked pale, but there was a brightness in her eyes, and a tender quiver about the
        mouth that spoke of renewed happiness.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="may"/><speech><character name="branbridge" gender="m" class="low">Mr. Branbridge</character> begged him so to stay another night that he had not the heart to refuse,</speech> she
        went on. <speaker name="may"/><speech>He is so kind, but I wish he hadn't stayed.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>I was at the station at half-past two. I felt rather annoyed with <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>. It seemed a sort of
        slight to the beautiful girl who loved him, that he should come as it were out of breath,
        and with the dust of travel upon him, to take her hand, which some of us would have given
        the best years of our lives to take.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>But when the three o'clock train glided in, and glided out again having brought no passengers
        to our little station, I was more than annoyed. There was no other train for thirty-five
        minutes; I calculated that, with much hurry, we might just get to the church in time for the
        ceremony; but, oh, what a fool to miss that first train! What other man could have done
        it?</paragraph>
    <paragraph>That thirty-five minutes seemed a year, as I wandered round the station reading the
        advertisements and the time-tables, and the company's bye-laws, and getting more and more
        angry with <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character>. This confidence in his own power of getting everything he
        wanted the minute he wanted it was leading him too far. I hate waiting. Every one does, but
        I believe I hate it more than any one else. The three thirty-five was late, of course.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>I ground my pipe between my teeth and stamped with impatience as I watched the signals.
        Click. The signal went down. Five minutes later I flung myself into the carriage that I had
        brought for <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Drive to the church!</speech> I said, as some one shut the door. <speaker name="narrator"/><speech><character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">Mr. Charrington</character> hasn't come by
        this train.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>Anxiety now replaced anger. What had become of the man? Could he have been taken suddenly
        ill? I had never known him have a day's illness in his life. And even so he might have
        telegraphed. Some awful accident must have happened to him. The thought that he had played
        her false never—no, not for a moment—entered my head. Yes, something terrible had happened
        to him, and on me lay the task of telling his bride. I almost wished the carriage would
        upset and break my head so that some one else might tell her, not I, who—but that's nothing
        to do with his story.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>It was five minutes to four as we drew up at the churchyard gate. A double row of eager
        on-lookers lined the path from lychgate to porch. I sprang from the carriage and passed up
        between them. Our gardener had a good front place near the door. I stopped.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><plot point="haunting"/><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Are they waiting still, <character name="byles" gender="m" class="low">Byles</character>?</speech> I asked, simply to gain time, for of course I knew they were
        by the waiting crowd's attentive attitude.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="byles"/><speech>Waiting, sir? No, no, sir; why, it must be over by now.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="narrator"/><speech>Over! Then <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">Mr. Charrington</character>'s come?</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="byles"/><speech>To the minute, sir; must have missed you somehow, and, I say, sir,</speech> lowering his voice, <speaker name="byles"/><speech>I
        never see Mr. <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character> the least bit so afore, but my opinion is he's been drinking pretty free.
        His clothes was all dusty and his face like a sheet. I tell you I didn't like the looks of
        him at all, and the folks inside are saying all sorts of things. You'll see, something's
        gone very wrong with Mr. <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John</character>, and he's tried liquor. He looked like a ghost, and in he went
        with his eyes straight before him, with never a look or a word for none of us; him that was
        always such a gentleman!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had never heard <character name="byles" gender="m" class="low">Byles</character> make so long a speech. The crowd in the churchyard were talking in
        whispers and getting ready rice and slippers to throw at the bride and bridegroom. The
        ringers were ready with their hands on the ropes to ring out the merry peal as the bride and
        bridegroom should come out.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A murmur from the church announced them; out they came. <character name="byles" gender="m" class="low">Byles</character> was right. <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character> did
        not look himself. There was dust on his coat, his hair was disarranged. He seemed to have
        been in some row, for there was a black mark above his eyebrow. He was deathly pale. But his
        pallor was not greater than that of the bride, who might have been carved in ivory—dress,
        veil, orange blossoms, face and all.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As they passed out the ringers stooped—there were six of them—and then, on the ears expecting
        the gay wedding peal, came the slow tolling of the passing bell.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>A thrill of horror at so foolish a jest from the ringers passed through us all. But the
        ringers themselves dropped the ropes and fled like rabbits out into the sunlight. The bride
        shuddered, and grey shadows came about her mouth, but the bridegroom led her on down the
        path where the people stood with the handfuls of rice; but the handfuls were never thrown,
        and the wedding-bells never rang. In vain the ringers were urged to remedy their mistake:
        they protested with many whispered expletives that they would see themselves further
        first.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>In a hush like the hush in the chamber of death the bridal pair passed into their carriage
        and its door slammed behind them.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then the tongues were loosed. A babel of anger, wonder, conjecture from the guests and the
        spectators.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="old forster"/><speech>If I'd seen his condition, sir,</speech> said <character name="old forster" gender="m" class="amb">old Forster</character> to me as we drove off, <speaker name="old forster"/><speech>I would have
        stretched him on the floor of the church, sir, by Heaven I would, before I'd have let him
        marry my daughter!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>Then he put his head out of the window.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="old forster"/><speech>Drive like hell,</speech> he cried to the coachman; <speaker name="old forster"/><speech>don't spare the horses.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>He was obeyed. We passed the bride's carriage. I forebore to look at it, and <character name="old forster" gender="m" class="amb">old Forster</character>
        turned his head away and swore. We reached home before it.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>We stood in the hall doorway, in the blazing afternoon sun, and in about half a minute we
        heard wheels crunching the gravel. When the carriage stopped in front of the steps old
        Forster and I ran down.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="old forster"/><speech>Great Heaven, the carriage is empty! And yet——</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>I had the door open in a minute, and this is what I saw—</paragraph>
    <paragraph>No sign of <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character>; and of <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May</character>, his wife, only a huddled heap of white satin lying
        half on the floor of the carriage and half on the seat.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="coachman"/><speech>I drove straight here, sir,</speech> said the <character name="coachman" gender="m" class="low">coachman</character>, as the bride's father lifted her out; <speaker name="coachman"/><speech>and
        I'll swear no one got out of the carriage.</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>We carried her into the house in her bridal dress and drew back her veil. I saw her face.
        Shall I ever forget it? White, white and drawn with agony and horror, bearing such a look of
        terror as I have never seen since except in dreams. And her hair, her radiant blonde hair, I
        tell you it was white like snow.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>As we stood, her father and I, half mad with the horror and mystery of it, a boy came up the
        avenue—a telegraph boy. They brought the orange envelope to me. I tore it open.</paragraph>
    <paragraph>"<character name="john" class="amb" gender="m">Mr. Charrington</character> was thrown from the dogcart on his way to the station at half-past one.
        Killed on the spot!"</paragraph>
    <paragraph>And he was married to <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May Forster</character> in our parish church at half-past three, in presence of
        half the parish.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><speaker name="john"/><speech>I shall be married, dead or alive!</speech></paragraph>
    <paragraph>What had passed in that carriage on the homeward drive? No one knows—no one will ever know.
        Oh, <character name="may" gender="f" class="amb">May</character>! oh, my dear!</paragraph>
    <paragraph>Before a week was over they laid her beside her husband in our little churchyard on the
        thyme-covered hill—the churchyard where they had kept their love-trysts.</paragraph>
    <paragraph><plot point="resolve"/>Thus was accomplished <character name="john" gender="m" class="amb">John Charrington</character>'s wedding.</paragraph>
