        <p>Wildheath Grange stood a little way back from the road, with a barren stretch of heath
            behind it, and a few tall fir-trees, with straggling wind-tossed heads, for its only
            shelter. It was a lonely house on a lonely road, little better than a lane, leading
            across a desolate waste of sandy fields to the sea-shore; and it was a house that bore a
            bad name among the natives of the village of Holcroft, which was the nearest place where
            humanity might be found.</p>

        <p>It was a good old house, nevertheless, substantially built in the days when there was no
            stint of stone and timber–a good old grey stone house with many gables, deep
            window-seats, and a wide staircase, long dark passages, hidden doors in queer corners,
            closets as large as some modern rooms, and cellars in which a company of soldiers might
            have lain perdu.</p>
<plot point="protag"/>
        <p>This spacious old mansion was given over to rats and mice, loneliness, echoes, and the
            occupation of three elderly people: <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>, whose forebears had been landowners
            of importance in the neighbourhood, and his two servants, <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character> and his wife, who
            had served the owner of that grim old house ever since he left the university, where he
            had lived fifteen years of his life–five as student, and ten as professor of natural
            science.</p>

        <p>At three-and-thirty <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> had seemed a middle-aged man; at fifty-six he looked
            and moved and spoke like an old man. During that interval of twenty-three years he had
            lived alone in Wildheath Grange, and the country people told each other that the house
            had made him what he was. This was a fanciful and superstitious notion on their part,
            doubtless, yet it would not have been difficult to have traced a certain affinity
            between the dull grey building and the man who lived in it. Both seemed alike remote
            from the common cares and interests of humanity; both had an air of settled melancholy,
            engendered by perpetual solitude; both had the same faded complexion, the same look of
            slow decay.</p>

        <p>Yet lonely as <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>’s life was at Wildheath Grange, he would not on any account
            have altered its tenor. He had been glad to exchange the comparative seclusion of
            college rooms for the unbroken solitude of Wildheath. He was a fanatic in his love of
            scientific research, and his quiet days were filled to the brim with labours that seldom
            failed to interest and satisfy him. There were periods of depression, occasional moments
            of doubt, when the goal towards which he strove seemed unattainable, and his spirit
            fainted within him. Happily such times were rare with him. He had a dogged power of
            continuity which ought to have carried him to the highest pinnacle of achievement, and
            which perhaps might ultimately have won for him a grand name and a world-wide renown,
            but for a catastrophe which burdened the declining years of his harmless life with an
            unconquerable remorse.</p>

        <p>One autumn morning–when he had lived just three-and-twenty years at Wildheath, and had
            only lately begun to perceive that his faithful butler and body servant, who was
            middle-aged when he first employed him, was actually getting old–<character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>’s breakfast
            meditations over the latest treatise on the atomic theory were interrupted by an abrupt
            demand from that very <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character>. The man was accustomed to wait upon his master in
            the most absolute silence, and his sudden breaking out into speech was almost as
            startling as if the bust of Socrates above the bookcase had burst into human
            language.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">It’s no use,</speech> said<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>; <speech ref="">my missus must have a
            girl!</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">A what?</speech> demanded <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>, without taking his eyes from the line he
            had been reading.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">A girl–a girl to trot about and wash up, and help the old lady. She’s getting
                weak on her legs, poor soul. We’ve none of us grown younger in the last twenty
                years.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Twenty years!</speech> echoed <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> scornfully. <speech ref="">What is twenty
                years in the formation of a strata–what even in the growth of an oak–the cooling of
                a volcano!</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Not much, perhaps, but it’s apt to tell upon the bones of a human
            being.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">The manganese staining to be seen upon some skulls would certainly
                indicate—-</speech> began the scientist dreamily.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I wish my bones were only as free from rheumatics as they were twenty years
                ago,</speech> pursued<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> testily; <speech ref="danielSkegg">and then, perhaps, I should make light
                of twenty years. Howsoever, the long and the short of it is, my missus must have a
                girl. She can’t go on trotting up and down these everlasting passages, and standing
                in that stone scullery year after year, just as if she was a young woman. She must
                have a girl to help.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Let her have twenty girls,</speech> said <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>, going back to his book.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">What’s the use of talking like that, sir. Twenty girls, indeed! We shall have
                rare work to get one.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Because the neighbourhood is sparsely populated?</speech> interrogated Mr.
            Bascom, still reading.</p>
<plot point="haunting"/>
        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">No, sir. Because this house is known to be haunted.</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> laid down his book, and turned a look of grave reproach upon his
            servant.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Skegg,</speech> he said in a severe voice, <speech ref="">I thought you had lived long
                enough with me to be superior to any folly of that kind.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I don’t say that I believe in ghosts,</speech> answered<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> with a
            semi-apologetic air; <speech ref="danielSkegg">but the country people do. There’s not a mortal among ’em
                that will venture across our threshold after nightfall.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Merely because <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>, who led a wild life in London, and lost his money
                and land, came home here broken-hearted, and is supposed to have destroyed himself
                in this house–the only remnant of property that was left him out of a fine
                estate.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Supposed to have destroyed himself!</speech> cried <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>; <speech ref="">why the fact is
                as well known as the death of Queen Elizabeth, or the great fire of London. Why,
                wasn’t he buried at the cross-roads between here and Holcroft?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">An idle tradition, for which you could produce no substantial proof,</speech>
            retorted <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I don’t know about proof; but the country people believe it as firmly as they
                believe their Gospel.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">If their faith in the Gospel was a little stronger they need not trouble
                themselves about <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Well,</speech> grumbled<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>, as he began to clear the table, <speech ref="danielSkegg">a girl of
                some kind we must get, but she’ll have to be a foreigner, or a girl that’s hard
                driven for a place.</speech></p>

        <p>When <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character> said a foreigner, he did not mean the native of some distant clime, but
            a girl who had not been born and bred at Holcroft.<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> had been raised and reared in
            that insignificant hamlet, and, small and dull as it was, he considered the world beyond
            it only margin.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was too deep in the atomic theory to give a second thought to the
            necessities of an old servant. <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> was an individual with whom he rarely came in
            contact. She lived for the most part in a gloomy region at the north end of the house,
            where she ruled over the solitude of a kitchen, that looked like a cathedral, and
            numerous offices of the sculler, larder, and pantry class, where she carried on a
            perpetual warfare with spiders and beetles, and wore her old life out in the labour of
            sweeping and scrubbing. She was a woman of severe aspect, dogmatic piety, and a bitter
            tongue. She was a good plain cook, and ministered diligently to her master’s wants. He
            was not an epicure, but liked his life to be smooth and easy, and the equilibrium of his
            mental power would have been disturbed by a bad dinner.</p>

        <p>He heard no more about the proposed addition to his household for a space of ten days,
            when <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character> again startled him amidst his studious repose by the abrupt
            announcement:</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I’ve got a girl!</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Oh,</speech> said <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>; <speech ref="michaelBascom">have you?</speech> and he went on with
            his book.</p>

        <p>This time he was reading an essay on phosphorus and its functions in relation to the
            human brain.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Yes,</speech> pursued<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> in his usual grumbling tone; <speech ref="danielSkegg">she was a waif
                and stray, or I shouldn’t have got her. If she’d been a native she’d never have come
                to us.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">I hope she’s respectable,</speech> said Michael.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Respectable! That’s the only fault she has, poor thing. She’s too good for the
                place. She’s never been in service before, but she says she’s willing to work, and I
                daresay my old woman will be able to break her in. Her father was a small tradesman
                at Yarmouth. He died a month ago, and left this poor thing homeless. Mrs. Midge, at
                Holcroft, is her aunt, and she said to the girl, Come and stay with me till you get
                a place; and the girl has been staying with Mrs. Midge for the last three weeks,
                trying to hear of a place. When Mrs. Midge heard that my missus wanted a girl to
                help, she thought it would be the very thing for her niece <character ref="maria">Maria</character>. Luckily <character ref="maria">Maria</character> had
                heard nothing about this house, so the poor innocent dropped me a curtsey, and said
                she’d be thankful to come, and would do her best to learn her duty. She’d had an
                easy time of it with her father, who had educated her above her station, like a fool
                as he was,</speech> growled<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">By your own account I’m afraid you’ve made a bad bargain,</speech> said Michael.
                <speech ref="michaelBascom">You don’t want a young lady to clean kettles and pans.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">If she was a young duchess my old woman would make her work,</speech> retorted
            <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character> decisively.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">And pray where are you going to put this girl?</speech> asked <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>, rather
            irritably; <speech ref="michaelBascom">I can’t have a strange young woman tramping up and down the passages
                outside my room. You know what a wretched sleeper I am, <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>. A mouse behind the
                wainscot is enough to wake me.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I’ve thought of that,</speech> answered the butler, with his look of ineffable
            wisdom. <speech ref="danielSkegg">I’m not going to put her on your floor. She’s to sleep in the
                attics.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Which room?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">The big one at the north end of the house. That’s the only ceiling that doesn’t
                let water. She might as well sleep in a shower-bath as in any of the other
                attics.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">The room at the north end,</speech> repeated <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> thoughtfully;
            <speech ref="michaelBascom">isn’t that—-?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Of course it is,</speech> snapped <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>; <speech ref="danielSkegg">but she doesn’t know anything
                about it.</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> went back to his books, and forgot all about the orphan from Yarmouth, until
            one morning on entering his study he was startled by the appearance of a strange girl,
            in a neat black and white cotton gown, busy dusting the volumes which were stacked in
            blocks upon his spacious writing-table–and doing it with such deft and careful hands
            that he had no inclination to be angry at this unwonted liberty. Old <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> had
            religiously refrained from all such dusting, on the plea that she did not wish to
            interfere with the master’s ways. One of the master’s ways, therefore, had been to
            inhale a good deal of dust in the course of his studies.</p>

        <p>The girl was a slim little thing, with a pale and somewhat old-fashioned face, flaxen
            hair, braided under a neat muslin cap, a very fair complexion, and light blue eyes. They
            were the lightest blue eyes <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> had ever seen, but there was a sweetness and
            gentleness in their expression which atoned for their insipid colour.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I hope you do not object to my dusting your books, sir,</speech> she said,
            dropping a curtsey.</p>

        <p>She spoke with a quaint precision which struck <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> as a pretty thing in its
            way.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">No; I don’t object to cleanliness, so long as my books and papers are not
                disturbed. If you take a volume off my desk, replace it on the spot you took it
                from. That’s all I ask.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I will be very careful, sir.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">When did you come here?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Only this morning, sir.</speech></p>

        <p>The student seated himself at his desk, and the girl withdrew, drifting out of the room
            as noiselessly as a flower blown across the threshold. <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> looked after her
            curiously. He had seen very little of youthful womanhood in his dry-as-dust career, and
            he wondered at this girl as at a creature of a species hitherto unknown to him. How
            fairly and delicately she was fashioned; what a translucent skin; what soft and pleasing
            accents issued from those rose-tinted lips. A pretty thing, assuredly, this kitchen
            wench! A pit that in all this busy world there could be no better work found for her
            than the scouring of pots and pans.</p>

        <p>Absorbed in considerations about dry bones, <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> thought no more of the pale-faced
            handmaiden. He saw her no more about his rooms. Whatever work she did there was done
            early in the morning, before the scholar’s breakfast.</p>

        <p>She had been a week in the house, when he met her one day in the hall. He was struck by
            the change in her appearance.</p>

        <p>The girlish lips had lost their rose-bud hue; the pale blue eyes had a frightened look,
            and there were dark rings round them, as in one whose nights had been sleepless, or
            troubled by evil dreams.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was so startled by an undefinable look in the girl’s face that, reserved
            as he was by habit and nature, he expanded so far as to ask her what ailed her.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">There is something amiss, I am sure,</speech> he said. <speech ref="michaelBascom">What is
                it?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Nothing, sir,</speech> she faltered, looking still more scared at his question.
                <speech ref="maria">Indeed, it is nothing; or nothing worth troubling you about.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Nonsense. Do you suppose, because I live among books, I have no sympathy with my
                fellow-creatures? Tell me what is wrong with you, child. You have been grieving
                about the father you have lately lost, I suppose.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">No, sir; it is not that. I shall never leave off being sorry for that. It is a
                grief which will last me all my life.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">What, there is something else then?</speech> asked Michael impatiently. <speech ref="michaelBascom">I
                see; you are not happy here. Hard work does not suit you. I thought as
                much.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Oh, sir, please don’t think that,</speech> cried the girl, very earnestly.
                <speech ref="maria">Indeed, I am glad to work–glad to be in service; it is only—-</speech></p>

        <p>She faltered and broke down, the tears rolling slowly from her sorrowful eyes, despite
            her effort to keep them back.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Only what?</speech> cried Michael, growing angry. <speech ref="">The girl is full of
                secrets and mysteries. What do you mean, wench?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I–I know it is very foolish, sir; but I am afraid of the room where I
                sleep.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Afraid! Why?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Shall I tell you the truth, sir? Will you promise not to be angry?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">I will not be angry if you will only speak plainly; but you provoke me by these
                hesitations and suppressions.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">And please, sir, do not tell <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> that I have told you. She would scold me;
                or perhaps even send me away.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom"><character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> shall not scold you. Go on, child.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">You may not know the room where I sleep, sir; it is a large room at one end of
                the house, looking towards the sea. I can see the dark line of water from the
                window, and I wonder sometimes to think that it is the same ocean I used to see when
                I was a child at Yarmouth. It is very lonely, sir, at the top of the house. Mr. and
                <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> sleep in a little room near the kitchen, you know, sir, and I am quite
                alone on the top floor.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Skegg told me you had been educated in advance of your position in life, <character ref="maria">Maria</character>. I
                should have thought the first effect of a good education would have been to make you
                superior to any foolish fancies about empty rooms.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Oh, pray, sir, do not think it is any fault in my education. Father took such
                pains with me; he spared no expense in giving me as good an education as a
                tradesman’s daughter need wish for. And he was a religious man, sir. He did not
                believe</speech>–here she paused, with a suppressed shudder–<speech ref="">in the spirits
                of the dead appearing to the living, since the days of miracles, when the ghost of
                Samuel appeared to Saul</speech>.</p>

        <p>He never put any foolish ideas into my head, sir. I hadn’t a thought of fear when I first
            lay down to rest in the big lonely room upstairs.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Well, what then?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">But on the very first night,</speech> the girl went on breathlessly, <speech ref="maria">I
                felt weighed down in my sleep as if there were some heavy burden laid upon my chest.
                It was not a bad dream, but it was a sense of trouble that followed me all through
                my sleep; and just at daybreak–it begins to be light a little after six–I woke
                suddenly, with the cold perspiration pouring down my face, and knew that there was
                something dreadful in the room.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">What do you mean by something dreadful. Did you see anything?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Not much, sir; but it froze the blood in my veins, and I knew it was this that
                had been following me and weighing upon me all through my sleep. In the corner,
                between the fire-place and the wardrobe, I saw a shadow–a dim, shapeless
                shadow—-</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Produced by an angle of the wardrobe, I daresay.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">No, sir; I could see the shadow of the wardrobe, distinct and sharp, as if it had
                been painted on the wall. This shadow was in the corner–a strange, shapeless mass;
                or, if it had any shape at all, it seemed—-</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">What?</speech> asked Michael eagerly.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">The shape of a dead body hanging against the wall!</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> grew strangely pale, yet he affected utter incredulity.</p>

        <p><speech ref="">Poor child,</speech> he said kindly; <speech ref="">you have been fretting about your
                father until your nerves are in a weak state, and you are full of fancies. A shadow
                in the corner, indeed; why, at daybreak, every corner is full of shadows. My old
                coat, flung upon a chair, will make you as good a ghost as you need care to
                see.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Oh, sir, I have tried to think it is my fancy. But I have had the same burden
                weighing me down every night. I have seen the same shadow every
            morning.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">But when broad daylight comes, can you not see what stuff your shadow is made
                of?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">No, sir: the shadow goes before it is broad daylight.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Of course, just like other shadows. Come, come, get these silly notions out of
                your head, or you will never do for the work-a-day world. I could easily speak to
                <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character>, and make her give you another room, if I wanted to encourage you in your
                folly. But that would be about the worst thing I could do for you. Besides, she
                tells me that all the other rooms on that floor are damp; and, no doubt, if she
                shifted you into one of them, you would discover another shadow in another corner,
                and get rheumatism into the bargain. No, my good girl, you must try to prove
                yourself the better for a superior education.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="">I will do my best, sir,</speech> <character ref="maria">Maria</character> answered meekly, dropping a curtsey.</p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> went back to the kitchen sorely depressed. It was a dreary life she led at
            Wildheath Grange–dreary by day, awful by night; for the vague burden and the shapeless
            shadow, which seemed so slight a matter to the elderly scholar, were unspeakably
            terrible to her. Nobody had told her that the house was haunted, yet she walked about
            those echoing passages wrapped round with a cloud of fear. She had no pity from <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel
            Skegg</character> and his <character ref="mrsSkegg">wife</character>. Those two pious souls had made up their minds that the character of
            the house should be upheld, so far as <character ref="maria">Maria</character> went. To her, as a foreigner, the Grange
            should be maintained to be an immaculate dwelling, tainted by no sulphurous blast from
            the under world. A willing, biddable girl had become a necessary element in the
            existence of <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character>. That girl had been found, and that girl must be kept. Any
            fancies of a supernatural character must be put down with a high hand.</p>

        <p><speech ref="mrsSkegg">Ghosts, indeed!</speech> cried the amiable <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>. <speech ref="">Read your Bible, <character ref="maria">Maria</character>,
                and don’t talk no more about ghosts.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">There are ghosts in the Bible,</speech> said <character ref="maria">Maria</character>, with a shiver at the
            recollection of certain awful passages in the Scripture she knew so well.</p>

        <p><speech ref="mrsSkegg">Ah, they was in their right place, or they wouldn’t ha’ been there,</speech>
            retorted <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character>. <speech ref="mrsSkegg">You ain’t agoin’ to pick holes in your Bible, I hope,
                <character ref="maria">Maria</character>, at your time of life.</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> sat down quietly in her corner by the kitchen fire, and turned over the leaves of
            her dead father’s Bible till she came to the chapters they two had loved best and
            oftenest read together. He had been a simple-minded, straightforward man, the Yarmouth
            cabinet-maker–a man full of aspirations after good, innately refined, instinctively
            religious. He and his motherless girl had spent their lives alone together, in the neat
            little home which <character ref="maria">Maria</character> had so soon learnt to cherish and beautify; and they had loved
            each other with an almost romantic love. They had had the same tastes, the same ideas.
            Very little had sufficed to make them happy. But inexorable death parted father and
            daughter, in one of those sharp, sudden partings which are like the shock of an
            earthquake–instantaneous ruin, desolation, and despair.</p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s fragile form had bent before the tempest. She had lived through a trouble that
            might have crushed a stronger nature. Her deep religious convictions, and her belief
            that this cruel parting would not be for ever, had sustained her. She faced life, and
            its cares and duties, with a gentle patience which was the noblest form of courage.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> told himself that the servant-girl’s foolish fancy about the room that had
            been given her was not a matter of serious consideration. Yet the idea dwelt in his mind
            unpleasantly, and disturbed him at his labours. The exact sciences require the complete
            power of a man’s brain, his utmost attention; and on this particular evening Michael
            found that he was only giving his work a part of his attention. The girl’s pale face,
            the girl’s tremulous tones, thrust themselves into the foreground of his thoughts.</p>

        <p>He closed his book with a fretful sigh, wheeled his large arm-chair round to the fire,
            and gave himself up to contemplation. To attempt study with so disturbed a mind was
            useless. It was a dull grey evening, early in November; the student’s reading-lamp was
            lighted, but the shutters were not yet shut, nor the curtains drawn. He could see the
            leaden sky outside his windows, the fir-tree tops tossing in the angry wind. He could
            hear the wintry blast whistling amidst the gables, before it rushed off seaward with a
            savage howl that sounded like a war-whoop.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> shivered, and drew nearer the fire.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">It’s childish, foolish nonsense,</speech> he said to himself, <speech ref="michaelBascom">yet it’s
                strange she should have that fancy about the shadow, for they say <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>
                destroyed himself in that room. I remember hearing it when I was a boy, from an old
                servant whose mother was housekeeper at the great house in Anthony’s time. I never
                heard how he died, poor fellow–whether he poisoned himself, or shot himself, or cut
                his throat; but I’ve been told that was the room. <character ref="danielSkegg">Old Skegg</character> has heard it too. I
                could see that by his manner when he told me the girl was to sleep
            there.</speech></p>

        <p>He sat for a long time, till the grey of evening outside his study windows changed to the
            black of night, and the war-whoop of the wind died away to a low complaining murmur. He
            sat looking into the fire, and letting his thoughts wander back to the past and the
            traditions he had heard in his boyhood.</p>

        <p>That was a sad, foolish story of his great-uncle, <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>: the pitiful story of a
            wasted fortune and a wasted life. A riotous collegiate career at Cambridge, a
            racing-stable at Newmarket, an imprudent marriage, a dissipated life in London, a
            runaway wife; an estate forfeited to Jew money-lenders, and then the fatal end.</p>
<plot point="history"/>
        <p>Michael had often heard that dismal story: how, when <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>’s fair false wife had
            left him, when his credit was exhausted, and his friends had grown tired of him, and all
            was gone except Wildheath Grange, Anthony, the broken-down man of fashion, had come to
            that lonely house unexpectedly one night, and had ordered his bed to be got ready for
            him in the room where he used to sleep when he came to the place for the wild duck
            shooting, in his boyhood. His old blunderbuss was still hanging over the mantelpiece,
            where he had left it when he came into the property, and could afford to buy the newest
            thing in fowling-pieces. He had not been to Wildheath for fifteen years; nav, for a good
            many of those years he had almost forgotten that the drear; old house belonged to
            him.</p>

        <p>The woman who had been housekeeper at Bascom Park, till house and lands had passed into
            the hands of the Jews, was at this time the sole occupant of Wildheath. She cooked some
            supper tor her master, and made him as comfortable as she could in the long untenanted
            dining-room; but she was distressed to find, when she cleared the table after he had
            gone upstairs to bed, that he had eaten hardly anything.</p>

        <p>Next morning she got his breakfast ready in the same room, which she managed to make
            brighter and cheerier than it had looked overnight. Brooms, dusting-brushes, and a good
            fire did much to improve the aspect of things. But the morning wore on to noon, and the
            old housekeeper listened in vain for her master’s footfall on the stairs. Noon waned to
            late afternoon. She had made no attempt to disturb him, thinking that he had worn
            himself out by a tedious journey on horseback, and that he was sleeping the sleep of
            exhaustion. But when the brief November day clouded with the first shadows of twilight,
            the old woman grew seriously alarmed, and went upstairs to her master’s door, where she
            waited in vain for any reply to her repeated calls and knockings.</p>

        <p>The door was locked on the inside, and the housekeeper was not strong enough to break it
            open. She rushed downstairs again full of fear, and ran bare-headed out into the lonely
            road. There was no habitation nearer than the turnpike on the old coach road, from which
            this side road branched off to the sea. There was scanty hope of a chance passer-by. The
            old woman ran along the road, hardly knowing whither she was going or what she was going
            to do, but with a vague idea that she must get somebody to help her.</p>

        <p>Chance favoured her. A cart, laden with sea-weed, came lumbering slowly along from the
            level line of sands yonder where the land melted into water. A heavy lumbering
            farm-labourer walked beside the cart.</p>

        <p><speech ref="mrsMidge">For God’s sake, come in and burst open my master’s door!</speech> she entreated,
            seizing the man by the arm. <speech ref="mrsMidge">He’s lying dead, or in a fit, and I can’t get to
                help him.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="labourer">All right, missus,</speech> answered the man, as if such an invitation were a
            matter of daily occurrence. <speech ref="labourer">Whoa, Dobbin; stond still, horse, and be donged to
                thee.</speech></p>

        <p>Dobbin was glad enough to be brought to anchor on the patch of waste grass in front of
            the Grange garden. His master followed the housekeeper upstairs, and shattered the
            old-fashioned box-lock with one blow of his ponderous fist.</p>

        <p>The old woman’s worst fear was realised. <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character> was dead. But the mode and manner
            of his death Michael had never been able to learn. The housekeeper’s daughter, who told
            him the story, was an old woman when he was a boy. She had only shaken her head, and
            looked unutterable things, when he questioned her too closely. She had never even
            admitted that the old squire had committed suicide. Yet the tradition of his
            self-destruction was rooted in the minds of the natives of Holcroft: and there was a
            settled belief that his ghost, at certain times and seasons, haunted Wildheath
            Grange.</p>

        <p>Now <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was a stern materialist. For him the universe with all its
            inhabitants, was a great machine, governed by inexorable laws. To such a man the idea of
            a ghost was simply absurd–as absurd as the assertion that two and two make five, or that
            a circle can be formed of a straight line. Yet he had a kind of dilettante interest in
            the idea of a mind which could believe in ghosts. The subject offered an amusing
            psychological study. This poor little pale girl, now, had evidently got some
            supernatural terror into her head, which could only be conquered by rational
            treatment.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">I know what I ought to do,</speech> <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> said to himself suddenly.
            <speech ref="michaelBascom">I’ll occupy that room myself tonight, and demonstrate to this foolish girl
                that her notion about the shadow is nothing more than a silly fancy, bred of
                timidity and low spirits. An ounce of proof is better than a pound of argument. If I
                can prove to her that I have spent a night in the room, and seen no such shadow, she
                will understand what an idle thing superstition is.</speech></p>

        <p>Daniel came in presently to shut the shutters.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Tell your wife to make up my bed in the room where <character ref="maria">Maria</character> has been sleeping, and
            to put her into one of the rooms on the first floor for to-night, <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>,</speech>
            said <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Sir?</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> repeated his order.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">That silly wench has been complaining to you about her room,</speech> <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>
            exclaimed indignantly. <speech ref="danielSkegg">She doesn’t deserve to be well fed and cared for in a
                comfortable home. She ought to go to the workhouse.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Don’t be angry with the poor girl, <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>. She has taken a foolish fancy into her
                head, and I want to show her how silly she is,</speech> said <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">And you want to sleep in his–in that room yourself,</speech> said the butler.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Precisely.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Well,</speech> mused <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>, <speech ref="danielSkegg">if he does walk–which I don’t believe–he was
                your own flesh and blood; and I don’t suppose he’ll do you any hurt.</speech></p>

        <p>When <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character> went back to the kitchen he railed mercilessly at poor <character ref="maria">Maria</character>, who sat
            pale and silent in her corner by the hearth, darning old <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character>’s grey worsted
            stockings, which were the roughest and harshest armour that ever human foot clothed
            itself withal. <speech ref="danielSkegg">Was there ever such a whimsical, fine, lady-like miss,</speech>
            demanded<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>, <speech ref="danielSkegg">to come into a gentleman’s house, and drive him out of his own
                bedroom to sleep in an attic, with her nonsenses and vagaries.</speech> If this was
            the result of being educated above one’s station,<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> declared that he was thankful
            he had never got so far in his schooling as to read words of two syllables without
            spelling. Education might be hanged for him, if this was all it led to.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I am very sorry,</speech> faltered <character ref="maria">Maria</character>, weeping silently over her work.
                <speech ref="maria">Indeed, <character ref="danielSkegg">Mr. Skegg</character>, I made no complaint. My master questioned me, and I told
                him the truth. That was all.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">All!</speech> exclaimed <character ref="danielSkegg">Mr. Skegg</character> irately; <speech ref="">all, indeed! I should think it
                was enough.</speech></p>

        <p>Poor <character ref="maria">Maria</character> held her peace. Her mind, fluttered by<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>’s unkindness, had wandered away
            from that bleak big kitchen to the lost home of the past–the snug little parlour where
            she and her father had sat beside the cosy hearth on such a night as this; she with her
            smart work-box and her plain sewing, he with the newspaper he loved to read; the petted
            cat purring on the rug, the kettle singing on the bright brass trivet, the tea-tray
            pleasantly suggestive of the most comfortable meal in the day.</p>

        <p>Oh, those happy nights, that dear companionship! Were they really gone for ever, leaving
            nothing behind them but unkindness and servitude?</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> retired later than usual that night. He was in the habit of sitting at his
            books long after every other lamp but his own had been extinguished. <character ref="danielSkegg">The Skeggs</character> had
            subsided into silence and darkness in their drear ground-floor bed-chamber. Tonight his
            studies were of a peculiarly interesting kind, and belonged to the order of recreative
            reading rather than of hard work. He was deep in the history of that mysterious people
            who had their dwelling-place in the Swiss lakes, and was much exercised by certain
            speculations and theories about them.</p>

        <p>The old eight-day clock on the stairs was striking two as Michael slowly ascended, candle
            in hand, to the hitherto unknown region of the attics. At the top of the staircase he
            found himself facing a dark narrow passage which led northwards, a passage that was in
            itself sufficient to strike terror to a superstitious mind, so black and uncanny did it
            look.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Poor child,</speech> mused <character ref="michaelBascom"><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character></character>, thinking of <character ref="maria">Maria</character>; <speech ref="michaelBascom">this attic
                floor is rather dreary, and for a young mind prone to fancies—-</speech></p>

        <p>He had opened the door of the north room by this time, and stood looking about him.</p>

        <p>It was a large room, with a ceiling that sloped on one side, but was fairly lofty upon
            the other; an old-fashioned room, full of old-fashioned furniture–big, ponderous,
            clumsy–associated with a day that was gone and people that were dead. A walnut-wood
            wardrobe stared him in the face–a wardrobe with brass handles, which gleamed out of the
            darkness like diabolical eyes. There was a tall four-post bedstead, which had been cut
            down on one side to accommodate the slope of the ceiling, and which had a misshapen and
            deformed aspect in consequence. There was an old mahogany bureau, that smelt of secrets.
            There were some heavy old chairs with rush bottoms, mouldy with age, and much worn.
            There was a corner washstand, with a big basin and a small jug–the odds and ends of past
            years. Carpet there was none, save a narrow strip beside the bed.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">It is a dismal room,</speech> mused Michael, with the same touch of pity for
            <character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s weakness which he had felt on the landing just now.</p>

        <p>To him it mattered nothing where he slept; but having let himself down to a lower level
            by his interest in the Swiss lake-people, he was in a manner humanised by the lightness
            of his evening’s reading, and was even inclined to compassionate the weaknesses of a
            foolish girl.</p>

        <p>He went to bed, determined to sleep his soundest. The bed was comfortable, well supplied
            with blankets, rather luxurious than otherwise, and the scholar had that agreeable sense
            of fatigue which promises profound and restful slumber.</p>

        <p>He dropped off to sleep quickly, but woke with a start ten minutes afterwards. What was
            this consciousness of a burden of care that had awakened him–this sense of all-pervading
            trouble that weighed upon his spirits and oppressed his heart–this icy horror of some
            terrible crisis in life through which he must inevitably pass? To him these feelings
            were as novel as they were painful. His life had flowed on with smooth and sluggish
            tide, unbroken by so much as a ripple of sorrow. Yet to-night he felt all the pangs of
            unavailing remorse; the agonising memory of a life wasted; the stings of humiliation and
            disgrace, shame, ruin; a hideous death, which he had doomed himself to die by his own
            hand. These were the horrors that pressed him round and weighed him down as he lay in
            <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>’s room.</p>

        <p>Yes, even he, the man who could recognise nothing in nature, or in nature’s God, better
            or higher than an irresponsible and invariable machine governed by mechanical laws, was
            fain to admit that here he found himself face to face with a psychological mystery. This
            trouble, which came between him and sleep, was the trouble that had pursued Anthony
            Bascom on the last night of his life. So had the suicide felt as he lay in that lonely
            room, perhaps striving to rest his wearied brain with one last earthly sleep before he
            passed to the unknown intermediate land where all is darkness and slumber. And that
            troubled mind had haunted the room ever since. It was not the ghost of the man’s body
            that returned to the spot where he had suffered and perished, but the ghost of his
            mind–his very self; no meaningless simulacrum of the clothes he were, and the figure
            that filled them.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was not the man to abandon his high ground of sceptical philosophy without
            a struggle. He tried his hardest to conquer this oppression that weighed upon mind and
            sense. Again and again he succeeded in composing himself to sleep, but only to wake
            again and again to the same torturing thoughts, the same remorse, the same despair. So
            the night passed in unutterable weariness; for though he told himself that the trouble
            was not his trouble, that there was no reality in the burden, no reason for the remorse,
            these vivid fancies were as painful as realities, and took as strong a hold upon
            him.</p>

        <p>The first streak of light crept in at the window–dim, and cold, and grey; then came
            twilight, and he looked at the corner between the wardrobe and the door.</p>

        <p>Yes; there was the shadow: not the shadow of the wardrobe only–that was clear enough, but
            a vague and shapeless something which darkened the dull brown wall; so faint, so shadow,
            that he could form no conjecture as to its nature, or the thing it represented. He
            determined to watch this shadow till broad daylight; but the weariness of the night had
            exhausted him, and before the first dimness of dawn had passed away he had fallen fast
            asleep, and was tasting the blessed balm of undisturbed slumber. When he woke the winter
            sun was shining in at the lattice, and the room had lost its gloomy aspect. It looked
            old-fashioned, and grey, and brown, and shabby; but the depth of its gloom had fled with
            the shadows and the darkness of night.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> rose refreshed by a sound sleep, which had lasted nearly three hours. He
            remembered the wretched feelings which had gone before that renovating slumber; but he
            recalled his strange sensations only to despise them, and he despised himself for having
            attached any importance to them.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Indigestion very likely,</speech> he told himself; <speech ref="michaelBascom">or perhaps mere fancy,
                engendered of that foolish girl’s story. The wisest of us is more under the dominion
                of imagination than he would care to confess. Well, <character ref="maria">Maria</character> shall not sleep in this
                room any more. There is no particular reason why she should, and she shall not be
                made unhappy to please <character ref="danielSkegg">old Skegg</character> and his <character ref="mrsSkegg">wife</character>.</speech></p>

        <p>When he had dressed himself in his usual leisurely way, <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> walked up to the
            corner where he had seen or imagined the shadow, and examined the spot carefully.</p>

        <p>At first sight he could discover nothing of a mysterious character. There was no door in
            the papered wall, no trace of a door that had been there in the past. There was no
            trap-door in the worm-eaten boards. There was no dark ineradicable stain to hint at
            murder. There was not the faintest suggestion of a secret or a mystery.</p>

        <p>He looked up at the ceiling. That was sound enough, save for a dirty patch here and there
            where the rain had blistered it.</p>

        <p>Yes; there was something–an insignificant thing, yet with a suggestion of grimness which
            startled him.</p>

        <p>About a foot below the ceiling he saw a large iron hook projecting from the wall, just
            above the spot where he had seen the shadow of a vaguely defined form. He mounted on a
            chair the better to examine this hook, and to understand, if he could, the purpose for
            which it had been put there.</p>

        <p>It was old and rusty. It must have been there for many years. Who could have placed it
            there, and why? It was not the kind of hook upon which one would hang a picture or one’s
            garments. It was placed in an obscure corner. Had <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character> put it there on the
            night he died; or did he find it there ready for a fatal use?</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">If I were a superstitious man,</speech> thought Michael, <speech ref="michaelBascom">I should be
                inclined to believe that <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character> hung himself from that rusty old
                hook.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Sleep well, sir?</speech> asked<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>, as he waited upon his master at
            breakfast.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Admirably,</speech> answered Michael, determined not to gratify the man’s
            curiosity.</p>

        <p>He had always resented the idea that Wildheath Grange was haunted.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Oh, indeed, sir. You were so late that I fancied—-</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Late, yes! I slept so well that I overshot my usual hour for waking. But,
            by-the-way, <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>, as that poor girl objects to the room, let her sleep somewhere
                else. It can’t make any difference to us, and it may make some difference to
                her.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Humph!</speech> muttered <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel</character> in his grumpy way; <speech ref="">you didn’t see
                anything queer up there, did you?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">See anything? Of course not.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Well, then, why should she see things? It’s all her silly
            fiddle-faddle.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Never mind, let her sleep in another room.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">There ain’t another room on the top floor that’s dry.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Then let her sleep on the floor below. She creeps about quietly enough, poor
                little timid thing. She won’t disturb me.</speech></p>

        <p>Daniel grunted, and his master understood the grunt to mean obedient assent; but here Mr.
            Bascom was unhappily mistaken. The proverbial obstinacy of the pig family is as nothing
            compared with the obstinacy of a cross-grained old man, whose narrow mind has never been
            illuminated by education.<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> was beginning to feel jealous of his master’s
            compassionate interest in the orphan girl. She was a sort of gentle clinging thing that
            might creep into an elderly bachelor’s heart unawares, and make herself a comfortable
            nest there.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">We shall have fine carryings-on, and me and my old woman will be nowhere, if I
                don’t put down my heel pretty strong upon this nonsense,</speech><character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> muttered to
            himself, as he carried the breakfast-tray to the pantry.</p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> met him in the passage.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Well, <character ref="danielSkegg">Mr. Skegg</character>, what did my master say?</speech> she asked breathlessly.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Did he see anything strange in the room?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">No, girl. What should he see? He said you were a fool.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Nothing disturbed him? And he slept there peacefully?</speech> faltered
            <character ref="maria">Maria</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Never slept better in his life. Now don’t you begin to feel ashamed of
                yourself?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Yes,</speech> she answered meekly; <speech ref="maria">I am ashamed of being so full of
                fancies. I will go back to my room tonight, <character ref="danielSkegg">Mr. Skegg</character>, if you like, and I will never
                complain of it again.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I hope you won’t,</speech> snapped <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character>; <speech ref="danielSkegg">you’ve given us trouble enough
                already.</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> sighed, and went about her work in saddest silence. The day wore slowly on, like
            all other days in that lifeless old house. The scholar sat in his study; <character ref="maria">Maria</character> moved
            softly from room to room, sweeping and dusting in the cheerless solitude. The mid-day
            sun faded into the grey of afternoon, and evening came down like a blight upon the dull
            old house.</p>

        <p>Throughout that day <character ref="maria">Maria</character> and her master never met. Anyone who had been so far interested
            in the girl as to observe her appearance would have seen that she was unusually pale,
            and that her eyes had a resolute look, as of one who was resolved to face a painful
            ordeal. She ate hardly anything all day. She was curiously silent. <character ref="danielSkegg">Skegg</character> and his <character ref="mrsSkegg">wife</character>
            put down both these symptoms to temper.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">She won’t eat and she won’t talk,</speech> said<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> to the partner of his
            joys. <speech ref="">That means sulkiness, and I never allowed sulkiness to master me when I
                was a young man, and you tried it on as a young woman, and I’m not going to be
                conquered by sulkiness in my old age.</speech></p>

        <p>Bed-time came, and <character ref="maria">Maria</character> bade <character ref="danielSkegg">the Skeggs</character> a civil good-night, and went up to her lonely
            garret without a murmur.</p>

        <p>The next morning came, and <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> looked in vain for her patient hand-maiden, when
            she wanted <character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s services in preparing the breakfast.</p>

        <p><speech ref="mrsSkegg">The wench sleeps sound enough this morning,</speech> said the old woman.
                <speech ref="mrsSkegg">Go and call her,<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>. My poor legs can’t stand them stairs.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Your poor legs are getting uncommon useless,</speech> muttered<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> testily, as
            he went to do his wife’s behest.</p>

        <p>He knocked at the door, and called <character ref="maria">Maria</character>–once, twice, thrice, many times; but there was
            no reply. He tried the door, and found it locked. He shook the door violently, cold with
            fear.</p>

        <p>Then he told himself that the girl had played him a trick. She had stolen away before
            daybreak, and left the door locked to frighten him. But, no; this could not be, for he
            could see the key in the lock when he knelt down and put his eye to the keyhole. The key
            prevented his seeing into the room.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">She’s in there, laughing in her sleeve at me,</speech> he told himself;
                <speech ref="daniel">but I’ll soon be even with her.</speech></p>

        <p>There was a heavy bar on the staircase, which was intended to secure the shutters of the
            window that lighted the stairs. It was a detached bar, and always stood in a corner near
            the window, which it was but rarely employed to fasten.<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> ran down to the landing,
            and seized upon this massive iron bar, and then ran back to the garret door.</p>

        <p>One blow from the heavy bar shattered the old lock, which was the same lock the carter
            had broken with his strong fist seventy years before. The door flew open, and<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>
            went into the attic which he had chosen for the stranger’s bed-chamber.</p>
<plot point="resolve"/>
        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> was hanging from the hook in the wall. She had contrived to cover her face decently
            with her handkerchief. She had hanged herself deliberately about an hour before<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>
            found her, in the early grey of morning. The doctor, who was summoned from Holcroft, was
            able to declare the time at which she had slain herself, but there was no one who could
            say what sudden access of terror had impelled her to the desperate act, or under what
            slow torture of nervous apprehension her mind had given way. The coroner’s jury returned
            the customary merciful verdict of "Temporary insanity".</p>

        <p>The girl’s melancholy fate darkened the rest of <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>’s life. He fled from
            Wildheath Grange as from an accursed spot, and from <character ref="danielSkegg">the Skeggs</character> as from the murderers of
            a harmless innocent girl. He ended his days at Oxford, where he found the society of
            congenial minds, and the books he loved. But the memory of <character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s sad face, and sadder
            death, was his abiding sorrow. Out of that deep shadow his soul was never lifted.</p>
