        <p>Wildheath Grange stood a little way back from the road, with a <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">barren</scary_word> stretch of heath behind it, and a few <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">tall</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">fir-trees</scary_word>, with <scary_word scale="2"
                pos="adj">straggling</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">wind-tossed</scary_word> heads, for its only shelter. It
            was a <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj">lonely</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">house</scary_word> on a <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj"
                >lonely</scary_word> road, little better than a lane, leading across a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">desolate</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">waste</scary_word> of sandy fields to the sea-shore;
            and it was a <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word> that bore a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">bad</scary_word> name among the natives of the village of
            Holcroft, which was <scary_phrase>the nearest place where <scary_word scale="1"
                    pos="noun">humanity</scary_word> might be found.</scary_phrase></p>

        <p>It was a good <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word>, nevertheless, substantially built
            in the days when there was no stint of stone and timber–a good <scary_word scale="1"
                pos="adj">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">grey</scary_word> stone <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun"
                >house</scary_word> with many <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">gables</scary_word>,
                <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">deep</scary_word> window-seats, and a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1"> wide</scary_word> staircase, <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj"
                >long</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj">dark</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">passages</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >hidden</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">doors</scary_word> in <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >queer</scary_word> corners, closets as large as some modern rooms, and cellars in
            which a company of soldiers might have lain perdu.</p>
        <plot point="protag"/>
        <p>This spacious <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> mansion was given over to
                <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">rats</scary_word> and <scary_word scale="2"
                pos="noun">mice</scary_word>, <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun"
                >loneliness</scary_word>, <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">echoes</scary_word>, and
            the occupation of three elderly people: <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael
                Bascom</character>, whose forebears had been landowners of importance in the
            neighbourhood, and his two servants, <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel
                Skegg</character> and his wife, who had served the owner of that <scary_word
                scale="2" pos="adj">grim</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">house</scary_word> ever since he left the university,
            where he had lived fifteen years of his life–five as student, and ten as professor of
            natural science.</p>

        <p>At three-and-thirty <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> had seemed
            a middle-aged man; at fifty-six he looked and moved and spoke like an <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> man. During that interval of twenty-three years
            he had lived <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">alone</scary_word> in Wildheath Grange, and
            the country people told each other that the <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun"
                >house</scary_word> had made him what he was. This was a fanciful and superstitious
            notion on their part, doubtless, yet it would not have been difficult to have traced a
            certain affinity between the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dull</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">grey</scary_word> building and the man who lived in it.
            Both seemed alike remote from the common cares and interests of humanity; both had an
            air of settled <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">melancholy</scary_word>, engendered by
            perpetual <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">solitude</scary_word>; both had the same faded
            complexion, the same look of <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">slow</scary_word>
            decay.</p>

        <p>Yet lonely as <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>’s life was at
            Wildheath Grange, he would not on any account have altered its tenor. He had been glad
            to exchange the comparative seclusion of college rooms for the unbroken <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">solitude</scary_word> of Wildheath. He was a fanatic in his love
            of scientific research, and his quiet days were filled to the brim with labours that
            seldom failed to interest and satisfy him. There were periods of depression, occasional
            moments of doubt, when the goal towards which he strove seemed unattainable, and his
            spirit fainted within him. Happily such times were rare with him. He had a dogged power
            of continuity which ought to have carried him to the highest pinnacle of achievement,
            and which perhaps might ultimately have won for him a grand name and a world-wide
            renown, but for a catastrophe which burdened the declining years of his harmless life
            with an unconquerable remorse.</p>

        <p>One autumn morning–when he had lived just three-and-twenty years at Wildheath, and had
            only lately begun to perceive that his faithful butler and body servant, who was
            middle-aged when he first employed him, was actually getting <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">old</scary_word>–<character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>’s
            breakfast meditations over the latest treatise on the atomic theory were interrupted by
            an abrupt demand from that <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i">very</scary_word>
            <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character>. The man was accustomed to wait
            upon his master in the most absolute <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >silence</scary_word>, and his sudden breaking out into speech was almost as
            startling as if the bust of Socrates above the bookcase had burst into human
            language.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">It’s no use,</speech> said<character ref="danielSkegg">

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">A what?</speech> demanded <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr.
                Bascom</character>, without taking his eyes from the line he had been reading.</p>

                legs, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> soul. We’ve none of us grown
                younger in the last twenty years.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Twenty years!</speech> echoed <character ref="michaelBascom"
                >Michael Bascom</character> scornfully. <speech ref="michaelBascom">What is twenty
                years in the formation of a strata–what even in the growth of an oak–the cooling of
                a volcano!</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Not much, perhaps, but it’s apt to tell upon the bones of a
                human being.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I wish my bones were only as free from rheumatics as they were
                twenty years ago,</speech> pursued<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>
            testily; <speech ref="danielSkegg">and then, perhaps, I should make light of twenty
                years. Howsoever, the long and the short of it is, my missus must have a girl. She
                can’t go on trotting up and down these everlasting passages, and standing in that
                stone scullery year after year, just as if she was a young woman. She must have a
                girl to help.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Let her have twenty girls,</speech> said <character
                ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>, going back to his book.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">What’s the use of talking like that, sir. Twenty girls, indeed!
                We shall have rare work to get one.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Because the neighbourhood is sparsely populated?</speech>
            interrogated Mr. Bascom, <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">still</scary_word> reading.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">No, sir. Because this <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun" synset="house.n.01"

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> laid down his book, and turned
            a look of <scary_word scale="0" pos="adj" synset="grave.s.01">grave</scary_word> reproach upon his
            servant.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Skegg,</speech> he said in a <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj" synset="severe.s.04"
                >severe</scary_word> voice, <speech ref="michaelBascom">I thought you had lived long
                enough with me to be superior to any folly of that kind.</speech></p>

                Daniel</character> with a semi-apologetic air; <speech ref="danielSkegg">but the
                country people do. There’s not a mortal among ’em that will venture across our
                threshold after nightfall.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Merely because <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony
            Bascom</character>, who led a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="wild.a.01">wild</scary_word>
            life in London, and <scary_word scale="1" pos="verb" synset="lose.v.01">lost</scary_word> his money and

            and is supposed to have destroyed himself in this <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun" synset="house.n.01"
                    >house</scary_word>–the only remnant of property that was left him out of a fine

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">An idle tradition, for which you could produce no substantial

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I don’t know about proof; but the country people believe it as
                firmly as they believe their Gospel.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">If their faith in the Gospel was a little stronger they need
            not <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1" synset="trouble_oneself.v.01">trouble</scary_word> themselves about
                    <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character>.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Well,</speech> grumbled<character ref="danielSkegg">
                Daniel</character>, as he began to clear the table, <speech ref="danielSkegg">a girl
                of some kind we must get, but she’ll have to be a foreigner, or a girl that’s hard
                driven for a place.</speech></p>

        <p>When <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel Skegg</character> said a foreigner, he did not
            mean the native of some distant clime, but a girl who had not been born and bred at
                Holcroft.<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> had been raised and reared
            in that insignificant hamlet, and, small and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="dull.a.01"
                >dull</scary_word> as it was, he considered the world beyond it only margin.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was too deep in the atomic
            theory to give a second thought to the necessities of an <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="old.a.01"
                >old</scary_word> servant. <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> was an
            individual with whom he rarely came in contact. She lived for the most part in a
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2" synset="gloomy.s.02">gloomy</scary_word> region at the north end of the
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2" synset="house.n.01">house</scary_word>, where she ruled over the
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="solitude.n.01">solitude</scary_word> of a kitchen, that looked like
            a cathedral, and numerous offices of the sculler, larder, and pantry class, where she
            carried on a perpetual warfare with spiders and beetles, and wore her <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1" synset="old.a.01">old</scary_word> life out in the labour of sweeping and
            scrubbing. She was a woman of <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="severe.s.04">severe</scary_word>
            aspect, dogmatic piety, and a bitter tongue. She was a good plain cook, and ministered
            diligently to her master’s wants. He was not an epicure, but liked his life to be smooth
            and easy, and the equilibrium of his mental power would have been disturbed by a
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj" synset="bad.a.01">bad</scary_word> dinner.</p>

        <p>He heard no more about the proposed addition to his <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun" synset="house.n.01"
                >house</scary_word>hold for a space of ten days, when <character ref="danielSkegg"
                >Daniel Skegg</character> again startled him amidst his studious repose by the
            abrupt announcement:</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I’ve got a girl!</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Oh,</speech> said <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael
                Bascom</character>; <speech ref="michaelBascom">have you?</speech> and he went on
            with his book.</p>

        <p>This time he was reading an essay on phosphorus and its functions in relation to the
            human brain.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Yes,</speech> pursued<character ref="danielSkegg">
                Daniel</character> in his usual grumbling tone; <speech ref="danielSkegg">she was a

                come to us.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">I hope she’s respectable,</speech> said Michael.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Respectable! That’s the only fault she has, <scary_word

                never been in service before, but she says she’s willing to work, and I daresay my
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="old.a.01">old</scary_word> woman will be able to break her
                in. Her father was a small tradesman at Yarmouth. He died a month ago, and left this
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="hapless.s.01">poor</scary_word> thing homeless. Mrs. Midge, at
                Holcroft, is her aunt, and she said to the girl, Come and stay with me till you get
                a place; and the girl has been staying with Mrs. Midge for the last three weeks,
                trying to hear of a place. When Mrs. Midge heard that my missus wanted a girl to
                help, she thought it would be the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i" synset="very.s.01">very</scary_word>
                thing for her niece <character ref="maria">Maria</character>. Luckily <character

                    >poor</scary_word> innocent dropped me a curtsey, and said she’d be thankful to
                come, and would do her best to learn her duty. She’d had an easy time of it with her
                father, who had educated her above her station, like a fool as he was,</speech>
                growled<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">By your own account I’m <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="afraid.a.01"

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> went back to his books, and forgot
            all about the orphan from Yarmouth, until one morning on entering his study he was
            startled by the appearance of a <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj" synset="strange.a.01">strange</scary_word>
            girl, in a neat black and white cotton gown, busy dusting the volumes which were stacked
            in blocks upon his spacious writing-table–and doing it with such deft and careful hands
            that he had no inclination to be angry at this unwonted liberty. <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1" synset="old.a.01">Old</scary_word>
            <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> had religiously refrained from all such
            dusting, on the plea that she did not wish to interfere with the master’s ways. One of
            the master’s ways, therefore, had been to inhale a good deal of dust in the course of
            his studies.</p>

        <p>The girl was a slim little thing, with a <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj" synset="pale.s.04"
            >pale</scary_word> and somewhat <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="antique.s.02"
                >old-fashioned</scary_word> face, flaxen hair, braided under a neat muslin cap, a
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i" synset="very.r.01">very</scary_word> fair complexion, and light blue
            eyes. They were the lightest blue eyes <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael
                Bascom</character> had ever seen, but there was a sweetness and gentleness in their
            expression which atoned for their insipid colour.</p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I hope you do not object to my dusting your books, sir,</speech> she
            said, dropping a curtsey.</p>

        <p>She spoke with a quaint precision which struck <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael
                Bascom</character> as a pretty thing in its way.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">No; I don’t object to cleanliness, so long as my books and
                papers are not disturbed. If you take a volume off my desk, replace it on the spot
                you took it from. That’s all I ask.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">I will be <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i" synset="very.r.01">very</scary_word> careful,

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">When did you come here?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Only this morning, sir.</speech></p>

        <p>The student seated himself at his desk, and the girl withdrew, drifting out of the room
            as noiselessly as a flower blown across the threshold. <character ref="michaelBascom"
                >Michael Bascom</character> looked after her <scary_word scale="1" pos="adv" synset="curiously.r.01"
                    >curiously</scary_word>. He had seen <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i" synset="very.r.01"
                >very</scary_word> little of youthful womanhood in his dry-as-dust career, and he
            wondered at this girl as at a creature of a species hitherto unknown to him. How fairly
            and delicately she was fashioned; what a translucent skin; what soft and pleasing
            accents issued from those rose-tinted lips. A pretty thing, assuredly, this kitchen
            wench! A pit that in all this busy world there could be no better work found for her
            than the scouring of pots and pans.</p>

        <p>Absorbed in considerations about dry bones, <character ref="michaelBascom">Mr.
            Bascom</character> thought no more of the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="pale.s.04"
                >pale</scary_word>-faced handmaiden. He saw her no more about his rooms. Whatever
            work she did there was done early in the morning, before the scholar’s breakfast.</p>

        <p>She had been a week in the <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun" synset="house.n.01">house</scary_word>, when he
            met her one day in the hall. He was struck by the change in her appearance.</p>

        <p>The girlish lips had <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2" synset="lose.v.01">lost</scary_word> their rose-bud
            hue; the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="pale.s.04">pale</scary_word> blue eyes had a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2" synset="frightened.s.01">frightened</scary_word> look, and there were dark rings round
            them, as in one whose nights had been <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2" synset="insomniac.s.01"
                >sleepless</scary_word>, or <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2" synset="troubled.a.01">troubled</scary_word>

            that, reserved as he was by habit and nature, he expanded so far as to ask her what
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun" synset="trouble.v.05">ailed</scary_word> her.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">There is something amiss, I am sure,</speech> he said.
                <speech ref="michaelBascom">What is it?</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="maria">Nothing, sir,</speech> she faltered, looking <scary_word pos="adv"
            scale="i" synset="still.r.01">still</scary_word> more scared at his question. <speech ref="maria"
                >Indeed, it is nothing; or nothing worth troubling you about.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Nonsense. Do you suppose, because I live among books, I have
                no sympathy with my fellow-creatures? Tell me what is wrong with you, <scary_word

        <p><speech ref="maria">No, sir; it is not that. I shall never leave off being sorry for

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">What, there is something else then?</speech> asked Michael
            impatiently. <speech ref="michaelBascom">I see; you are not happy here. Hard work does

        <p><speech ref="maria">Oh, sir, please don’t think that,</speech> cried the girl,
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i" synset="very.r.01">very</scary_word> earnestly. <speech ref="maria"
                >Indeed, I am glad to work–glad to be in service; it is only—-</speech></p>

        <p>She faltered and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2" synset="break.v.09">broke</scary_word> down, the tears
            rolling <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2" synset="slowly.r.01">slowly</scary_word> from her sorrowful eyes,

        <p><speech ref="maria">Shall I tell you the truth, sir? Will you promise not to be

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">I will not be angry if you will only speak plainly; but you

        <p><speech ref="maria">And please, sir, do not tell <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs.

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom"><character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> shall not

        <p><speech ref="maria">You may not know the room where I sleep, sir; it is a large room at

                the sea. I can see the dark line of water from the window, and I wonder sometimes to
                think that it is the same ocean I used to see when I was a <scary_word pos="noun"

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Skegg told me you had been educated in advance of your

        <p><speech ref="maria">Oh, pray, sir, do not think it is any fault in my education. Father

                expense in giving me as good an education as a tradesman’s daughter need wish for.
                And he was a religious man, sir. He did not believe</speech>–here she paused, with a

                through my sleep; and just at daybreak–it begins to be light a little after six–I

                in the room.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">What do you mean by something <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2" synset="awful.s.02"

        <p><speech ref="maria">Not much, sir; but it froze the blood in my veins, and I knew it was

            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1" synset="darkness.n.02">shadow</scary_word>, which seemed so slight a matter to

            best and oftenest read together. He had been a simple-minded, straightforward man, the
            Yarmouth cabinet-maker–a man full of aspirations after good, innately refined,
            <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1" synset="instinctively.r.01">instinctively</scary_word> religious. He and his

            together, in the neat little home which <character ref="maria">Maria</character> had so

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s fragile form had bent before the tempest. She
            had lived through a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1" synset="trouble.n.01">trouble</scary_word> that might
            have crushed a stronger nature. Her deep religious convictions, and her belief that this
            cruel parting would not be for ever, had sustained her. She faced life, and its cares
            and duties, with a gentle patience which was the noblest form of courage.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> told himself that the

            <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj" synset="serious.s.02">serious</scary_word> consideration. Yet the idea
            dwelt in his mind unpleasantly, and disturbed him at his labours. The exact sciences
            require the complete power of a man’s brain, his utmost attention; and on this

        <p>He closed his book with a fretful sigh, wheeled his large arm-chair round to the fire,
            and gave himself up to contemplation. To attempt study with so disturbed a mind was

        <p>He sat for a long time, till the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1" synset="grey.s.01">grey</scary_word> of
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun" synset="evening.n.01">evening</scary_word> outside his study windows
            changed to the black of night, and the war-whoop of the wind died away to a low
            complaining murmur. He sat looking into the fire, and letting his thoughts wander back
            to the past and the traditions he had heard in his boyhood.</p>

        <p>That was a sad, foolish story of his great-uncle, <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony
                Bascom</character>: the pitiful story of a wasted fortune and a wasted life. A
            riotous collegiate career at Cambridge, a racing-stable at Newmarket, an imprudent
            marriage, a dissipated life in London, a runaway wife; an estate forfeited to Jew
            money-lenders, and then the fatal end.</p>
        <plot point="history"/>
        <p>Michael had often heard that dismal story: how, when <character ref="anthonyBascom"
                >Anthony Bascom</character>’s fair false wife had left him, when his credit was
            exhausted, and his friends had grown tired of him, and all was gone except Wildheath
            Grange, Anthony, the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">broken-down</scary_word> man of
            fashion, had come to that lonely <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">house</scary_word>
            unexpectedly one night, and had ordered his bed to be got ready for him in the room
            where he used to sleep when he came to the place for the <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj"
                >wild</scary_word> duck shooting, in his boyhood. His <scary_word pos="adj"

                >still</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="verb">hanging</scary_word> over the mantelpiece, where he had
            left it when he came into the property, and could afford to buy the newest thing in
            fowling-pieces. He had not been to Wildheath for fifteen years; nav, for a good many of
            those years he had almost forgotten that the <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj"
                >dreary</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word> belonged to him.</p>

        <p>The woman who had been <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">housekeeper</scary_word> at
            Bascom Park, till <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word> and lands had
            passed into the hands of the Jews, was at this time the sole occupant of Wildheath. She
            cooked some supper tor her master, and made him as comfortable as she could in the long
            untenanted dining-room; but she was distressed to find, when she cleared the table after
            he had gone upstairs to bed, that he had eaten hardly anything.</p>

        <p>Next morning she got his breakfast ready in the same room, which she managed to make
            brighter and cheerier than it had looked overnight. Brooms, dusting-brushes, and a good
            fire did much to improve the aspect of things. But the morning wore on to noon, and the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">housekeeper</scary_word> listened in vain for her
            master’s footfall on the stairs. Noon waned to late afternoon. She had made no attempt
            to disturb him, thinking that he had worn himself out by a tedious journey on horseback,
            and that he was sleeping the sleep of exhaustion. But when the brief <scary_word

                >clouded</scary_word> with the first <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"

                pos="adj">seriously</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="verb">alarmed</scary_word>, and went upstairs to her master’s
            door, where she waited in vain for any reply to her <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >repeated</scary_word> calls and knockings.</p>

        <p>The door was <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">locked</scary_word> on the inside, and the
                <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">housekeeper</scary_word> was not strong enough to
            break it open. She rushed downstairs again full of <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3"
                >fear</scary_word>, and ran bare-headed out into the lonely road. There was no
            habitation nearer than the turnpike on the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >old</scary_word> coach road, from which this side road branched off to the sea.
            There was scanty hope of a chance passer-by. The <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >old</scary_word> woman ran along the road, hardly knowing whither she was going or
            what she was going to do, but with a vague idea that she must get somebody to help
            her.</p>

        <p>Chance favoured her. A cart, laden with sea-weed, came lumbering <scary_word pos="adv"
                scale="1">slowly</scary_word> along from the level line of sands yonder where the
            land melted into water. A heavy lumbering farm-labourer walked beside the cart.</p>

            was an <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> woman when he was a boy. She had
            only shaken her head, and looked unutterable things, when he questioned her too closely.
            She had never even admitted that the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            squire had committed suicide. Yet the tradition of his self-destruction was rooted in
            the minds of the natives of Holcroft: and there was a settled belief that his

        <p>Now <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was a stern materialist.
            For him the universe with all its inhabitants, was a great machine, governed by
            inexorable laws. To such a man the idea of a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >ghost</scary_word> was simply absurd–as absurd as the assertion that two and two
            make five, or that a circle can be formed of a straight line. Yet he had a kind of
            dilettante interest in the idea of a mind which could believe in <scary_word pos="noun"

            <character ref="maria">Maria</character> held her peace. Her mind, fluttered by
                <character ref="danielSkegg">Daniel</character>’s unkindness, had wandered away from
            that bleak big kitchen to the <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">lost</scary_word> home of
            the past–the snug little parlour where she and her father had sat beside the cosy hearth
            on such a night as this; she with her smart work-box and her plain sewing, he with the
            newspaper he loved to read; the petted cat purring on the rug, the kettle singing on the
            bright brass trivet, the tea-tray pleasantly suggestive of the most comfortable meal in
            the day.</p>

        <p>Oh, those happy nights, that dear companionship! Were they really gone for ever, leaving
            nothing behind them but unkindness and servitude?</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> retired later than usual that
            night. He was in the habit of sitting at his books long after every other lamp but his
            own had been extinguished. <character ref="danielSkegg">The Skeggs</character> had
            subsided into <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">silence</scary_word> and <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">darkness</scary_word> in their <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj"
                >drear</scary_word> ground-floor bed-chamber. Tonight his studies were of a
            peculiarly interesting kind, and belonged to the order of recreative reading rather than
            of hard work. He was deep in the history of that <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >mysterious</scary_word> people who had their dwelling-place in the Swiss lakes, and
            was much exercised by certain speculations and theories about them.</p>

        <p>The <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> eight-day clock on the stairs was
            striking two as Michael <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">slowly</scary_word> ascended,
            candle in hand, to the hitherto unknown region of the attics. At the top of the
            staircase he found himself facing a dark narrow passage which led northwards, a passage
            that was in itself sufficient to strike <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun"
                >terror</scary_word> to a <scary_word scale="2" pos="adj">superstitious</scary_word>
            mind, so black and uncanny did it look.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom"><scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">Poor</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">child</scary_word>,</speech> mused <character
                ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character>, thinking of <character ref="maria"
                >Maria</character>; <speech ref="michaelBascom">this attic floor is rather
                    <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">dreary</scary_word>, and for a young mind prone
                to fancies—-</speech></p>

        <p>He had opened the door of the north room by this time, and stood looking about him.</p>

        <p>It was a large room, with a ceiling that sloped on one side, but was fairly lofty upon
            the other; an <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old-fashioned</scary_word> room, full of
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old-fashioned</scary_word> furniture–big, ponderous,
            clumsy–associated with a day that was gone and people that were <scary_word scale="0"
                pos="adj">dead</scary_word>. A walnut-wood wardrobe stared him in the face–a
            wardrobe with brass handles, which gleamed out of the darkness like diabolical eyes.
            There was a <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">tall</scary_word> four-post bedstead, which
            had been cut down on one side to accommodate the slope of the ceiling, and which had a
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">misshapen</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">deformed</scary_word> aspect in consequence. There was an <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">old</scary_word> mahogany bureau, that smelt of <scary_word
                scale="2" pos="noun">secrets</scary_word>. There were some heavy <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">old</scary_word> chairs with rush bottoms, <scary_word scale="2"
                pos="adj">mould</scary_word>y with age, and much worn. There was a corner washstand,
            with a big basin and a small jug–the odds and ends of past years. Carpet there was none,
            save a narrow strip beside the bed.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">It is a dismal room,</speech> mused Michael, with the same
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">touch</scary_word> of pity for <character
                ref="maria">Maria</character>’s weakness which he had felt on the landing just
            now.</p>

        <p>To him it mattered nothing where he slept; but having let himself down to a lower level
            by his interest in the Swiss lake-people, he was in a manner humanised by the lightness
            of his <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">evening</scary_word>’s reading, and was even
            inclined to compassionate the weaknesses of a foolish girl.</p>

        <p>He went to bed, determined to sleep his soundest. The bed was comfortable, well supplied
            with blankets, rather luxurious than otherwise, and the scholar had that agreeable sense
            of fatigue which promises profound and restful slumber.</p>

        <p>He dropped off to sleep quickly, but woke with a start ten minutes afterwards. What was
            this consciousness of a burden of care that had awakened him–this sense of all-pervading
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">trouble</scary_word> that weighed upon his spirits
            and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">oppressed</scary_word> his heart–this <scary_word
                scale="2" pos="adj">icy</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">horror</scary_word> of some <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">terrible</scary_word> crisis in life through which he must inevitably
            pass? To him these feelings were as novel as they were <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj"
                >painful</scary_word>. His life had flowed on with smooth and sluggish tide,
            unbroken by so much as a ripple of sorrow. Yet to-night he felt all the pangs of
            unavailing remorse; the agonising memory of a life wasted; the stings of humiliation and
            disgrace, shame, ruin; a hideous death, which he had doomed himself to die by his own
            hand. These were the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">horrors</scary_word> that pressed
            him round and weighed him down as he lay in <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony
                Bascom</character>’s room.</p>

        <p>Yes, even he, the man who could recognise nothing in nature, or in nature’s God, better
            or higher than an irresponsible and invariable machine governed by mechanical laws, was
            fain to admit that here he found himself face to face with a psychological <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">mystery</scary_word>. This <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >trouble</scary_word>, which came between him and sleep, was the trouble that had
            pursued Anthony Bascom on the last night of his life. So had the suicide felt as he lay
            in that lonely room, perhaps striving to rest his wearied brain with one last earthly
            sleep before he passed to the unknown intermediate land where all is darkness and
            slumber. <scary_phrase>And that <scary_word scale="3" pos="adj">troubled</scary_word> mind had
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">haunted</scary_word> the room ever since.</scary_phrase> It was not
            the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">ghost</scary_word> of the man’s body that returned
            to the spot where he had suffered and perished, but the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3"
                >ghost</scary_word> of his mind–his <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i"
                >very</scary_word> self; no meaningless simulacrum of the clothes he were, and the
            figure that filled them.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character> was not the man to abandon his
            high ground of sceptical philosophy without a struggle. He tried his hardest to conquer
            this oppression that weighed upon mind and sense. Again and again he succeeded in
            composing himself to sleep, but only to wake again and again to <scary_phrase>the same
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">torturing</scary_word> thoughts, the same
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">remorse</scary_word>, the same <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="2">despair</scary_word>.</scary_phrase> So the night passed in
            unutterable weariness; for though he told himself that the <scary_word scale="1"
                pos="noun">trouble</scary_word> was not his <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >trouble</scary_word>, that there was no reality in the burden, no reason for the
            remorse, these vivid fancies were as <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >painful</scary_word> as realities, and took as strong a hold upon him.</p>

        <p>The first streak of light crept in at the window–dim, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                >cold</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">grey</scary_word>; then came
                <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun">twilight</scary_word>, and he looked at the corner
            between the wardrobe and the door.</p>

        <p>Yes; there was the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">shadow</scary_word>: not the
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">shadow</scary_word> of the wardrobe only–that was
            clear enough, <scary_phrase>but a vague and <scary_word scale="3" pos="adj">shapeless</scary_word>
            something which darkened the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">dull</scary_word> brown
            wall; so faint, so <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">shadow</scary_word>, that he could
            form no conjecture as to its nature, or the thing it represented.</scary_phrase> He determined to watch
            this <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">shadow</scary_word> till broad daylight; but the
            weariness of the night had exhausted him, and before the first dimness of dawn had
            passed away he had fallen fast asleep, and was tasting the blessed balm of undisturbed
            slumber. When he woke the winter sun was shining in at the lattice, and the room had
                <scary_word scale="1" pos="verb">lost</scary_word> its <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">gloomy</scary_word> aspect. It looked <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >old-fashioned</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">grey</scary_word>,
            and brown, and shabby; but the depth of its <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >gloom</scary_word> had fled with the shadows and the darkness of night.</p>

        <p><character ref="michaelBascom">Mr. Bascom</character> rose refreshed by a sound sleep,
            which had lasted nearly three hours. He remembered the wretched feelings which had gone
            before that renovating slumber; but he recalled his <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj"
                >strange</scary_word> sensations only to despise them, and he despised himself for
            having attached any importance to them.</p>

        <p><speech ref="michaelBascom">Indigestion <scary_word pos="adj" scale="i">very</scary_word>
                likely,</speech> he told himself; <speech ref="michaelBascom">or perhaps mere fancy,
                engendered of that foolish girl’s story. The wisest of us is more under the dominion
                of imagination than he would care to confess. Well, <character ref="maria"
                    >Maria</character> shall not sleep in this room any more. There is no particular

                    >wife</character>.</speech></p>

        <p>When he had dressed himself in his usual leisurely way, <character ref="michaelBascom"
                >Mr. Bascom</character> walked up to the corner where he had seen or imagined the
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">shadow</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="verb"
                scale="2">examined</scary_word> the spot carefully.</p>

        <p>At first sight he could discover nothing of a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >mysterious</scary_word> character. There was no door in the papered wall, no trace
            of a door that had been there in the past. There was no trap-door in the worm-eaten
            boards. There was no dark ineradicable stain to hint at <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >murder</scary_word>. There was not the faintest suggestion of a <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="2">secret</scary_word> or a <scary_word scale="2" pos="noun"
                >mystery</scary_word>.</p>

        <p>He looked up at the ceiling. That was sound enough, save for a dirty patch here and there
            where the rain had blistered it.</p>

        <p>Yes; there was something–an insignificant thing, yet with a suggestion of grimness which
            startled him.</p>

        <p>About a foot below the ceiling he saw a large iron hook projecting from the wall, just
            above the spot where he had seen the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3"
                >shadow</scary_word> of a vaguely defined form. He mounted on a chair the better to
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">examine</scary_word> this hook, and to understand,
            if he could, the purpose for which it had been put there.</p>

        <p>It was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">old</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="3">rusty</scary_word>. It must have been there for many years. Who could have
            placed it there, and why? It was not the kind of hook upon which one would <scary_word
                scale="1" pos="verb">hang</scary_word> a picture or one’s garments. It was placed in
            an obscure corner. Had <character ref="anthonyBascom">Anthony Bascom</character> put it

        <p>He had always resented the idea that Wildheath Grange was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"

        <p>Daniel grunted, and his master understood the grunt to mean obedient assent; but here Mr.

                    ref="danielSkegg">Mr. Skegg</character>, if you like, and I will never complain
                of it again.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">I hope you won’t,</speech> snapped <character ref="danielSkegg"
                >Skegg</character>; <speech ref="danielSkegg">you’ve given us <scary_word pos="noun"
                    scale="1">trouble</scary_word> enough already.</speech></p>

        <p><character ref="maria">Maria</character> sighed, and went about her work in saddest
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">silence</scary_word>. The day wore <scary_word
                pos="adv" scale="1">slowly</scary_word> on, like all other days in that lifeless
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word>. The scholar sat in his study;
                <character ref="maria">Maria</character> moved softly from room to room, sweeping
            and dusting in the cheerless <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">solitude</scary_word>. The
            mid-day sun faded into the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">grey</scary_word> of
            afternoon, and <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">evening</scary_word> came down like a
            blight upon the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dull</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">house</scary_word>.</p>

        <p>Throughout that day <character ref="maria">Maria</character> and her master never met.
            Anyone who had been so far interested in the girl as to observe her appearance would
            have seen that she was unusually <scary_word scale="1" pos="adj">pale</scary_word>, and
            that her eyes had a resolute look, as of one who was resolved to face a <scary_word
                scale="2" pos="adj">painful</scary_word> ordeal. She ate hardly anything all day.
            She was <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">curiously</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">silent</scary_word>. <character ref="danielSkegg"
                >Skegg</character> and his <character ref="mrsSkegg">wife</character> put down both
            these symptoms to temper.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">She won’t eat and she won’t talk,</speech> said <character
                ref="danielSkegg">Daniel</character> to the partner of his joys. <speech
                ref="danielSkegg">That means sulkiness, and I never allowed sulkiness to master me
                when I was a young man, and you tried it on as a young woman, and I’m not going to
                be conquered by sulkiness in my <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
                age.</speech></p>

        <p>Bed-time came, and <character ref="maria">Maria</character> bade <character
                ref="danielSkegg">the Skeggs</character> a civil good-night, and went up to her
            lonely garret without a murmur.</p>

        <p>The next morning came, and <character ref="mrsSkegg">Mrs. Skegg</character> looked in
            vain for her patient hand-maiden, when she wanted <character ref="maria"
                >Maria</character>’s services in preparing the breakfast.</p>

        <p><speech ref="mrsSkegg">The wench sleeps sound enough this morning,</speech> said the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> woman. <speech ref="mrsSkegg">Go
                and call her,<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character>. My <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> legs can’t stand them stairs.</speech></p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">Your <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> legs are
                getting uncommon useless,</speech> muttered<character ref="danielSkegg">
                Daniel</character> testily, as he went to do his wife’s behest.</p>

        <p>He knocked at the door, and called <character ref="maria">Maria</character>–once, twice,
            thrice, many times; but there was no reply. He tried the door, and found it <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="1">locked</scary_word>. He shook the door <scary_word pos="adv"
                scale="2">violently</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">cold</scary_word>
            with <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">fear</scary_word>.</p>

        <p>Then he told himself that the girl had played him a trick. She had stolen away before
            daybreak, and left the door <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">locked</scary_word> to
                <scary_word scale="3" pos="verb">frighten</scary_word> him. But, no; this could not
            be, for he could see the key in the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">lock</scary_word>
            when he knelt down and put his eye to the keyhole. The key prevented his seeing into the
            room.</p>

        <p><speech ref="danielSkegg">She’s in there, laughing in her sleeve at me,</speech> he told
            himself; <speech ref="daniel">but I’ll soon be even with her.</speech></p>

        <p>There was a heavy bar on the staircase, which was intended to secure the shutters of the
            window that lighted the stairs. It was a detached bar, and always stood in a corner near
            the window, which it was but rarely employed to fasten.<character ref="danielSkegg">
                Daniel</character> ran down to the landing, and seized upon this massive iron bar,
            and then ran back to the garret door.</p>

        <p>One blow from the heavy bar <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">shattered</scary_word> the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">lock</scary_word>, which was the same <scary_word

                scale="1">broken</scary_word> with his strong fist seventy years before. The door
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">flew</scary_word> open, and <character
                ref="danielSkegg">Daniel</character> went into the attic which he had chosen for the
                <scary_word scale="1" pos="noun">stranger</scary_word>’s bed-chamber.</p>

                before<character ref="danielSkegg"> Daniel</character> found her, in the early
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">grey</scary_word> of morning. The doctor, who was
            summoned from Holcroft, was able to declare the time at which she had slain herself, but
            there was no one who could say what sudden access of <scary_word scale="3" pos="noun"
                >terror</scary_word> had impelled her to the desperate act, or under what
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">slow</scary_word>

            coroner’s jury returned the customary merciful verdict of "Temporary insanity".</p>
        <p>The girl’s <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">melancholy</scary_word> fate darkened the rest
            of <character ref="michaelBascom">Michael Bascom</character>’s life. He fled from
            Wildheath Grange as from an accursed spot, and from <character ref="danielSkegg">the
                Skeggs</character> as from the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >murderers</scary_word> of a harmless innocent girl. He ended his days at Oxford,
            where he found the society of congenial minds, and the books he loved. But the memory of
                <character ref="maria">Maria</character>’s sad face, and sadder death, was his
            abiding sorrow. Out of that deep <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">shadow</scary_word>
            his soul was never lifted.</p>
