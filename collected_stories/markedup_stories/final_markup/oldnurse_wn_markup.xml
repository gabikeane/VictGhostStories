        <p> You know, my dears, that your mother was an orphan, and an only child; and I daresay you
            have heard that your grandfather was a clergyman up in Westmoreland, where I come from.
            I was just a girl in the village school, when, one day, your grandmother came in to ask
            the mistress if there was any scholar there who would do for a nurse-maid; and mighty
            proud I was, I can tell ye, when the mistress called me up, and spoke of me being a good
            girl at my needle, and a steady, honest girl, and one whose parents were <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> respectable, though they might be <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word>. I thought I should like nothing better than
            to serve the pretty young lady, who was blushing as <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >deep</scary_word> as I was, as she spoke of the coming baby, and what I should have
            to do with it. However, I see you don't care so much for this part of my story, as for
            what you think is to come, so I'll tell you at once. I was engaged and settled at the
            parsonage before Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> (that was the
            baby, who is now your mother) was born. To be sure, I had little enough to do with her
            when she came, for she was never out of her mother's arms, and slept by her all
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word> long; and proud enough was I
            sometimes when missis trusted her to me. There never was such a baby before or since,
            though you've all of you been fine enough in your turns; but for sweet, winning ways,
            you've none of you come up to your mother. She took after her mother, who was a real
            lady born; a <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character>, a grand-daughter
            of <character ref="lordFurnivall">Lord Furnivall</character>'s, in Northumberland. I
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">believe</scary_word> she had neither brother nor
            sister, and had been brought up in my lord's family till she had married your
            grandfather, who was just a curate, son to a shopkeeper in Carlisle—but a clever, fine
            gentleman as ever was—and one who was a right-<scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >down</scary_word> hard worker in his parish, which was <scary_word pos="mod"
                scale="0">very</scary_word> wide, and scattered all abroad over the Westmoreland
            Fells. When your mother, little Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>,
            was about four or five years old, both her parents <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >died</scary_word> in a fortnight—one after the other. Ah! that was a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">sad</scary_word> time. My pretty young mistress and me was
            looking for another baby, when my master came home from one of his long rides,
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">wet</scary_word> and tired, and took the fever he
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">died</scary_word> of; and then she never held up
            her head again, but just lived to see her <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >dead</scary_word> baby, and have it laid on her breast, before she sighed away her
            life. My mistress had asked me, on her death-bed, never to leave Miss <character
                ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>; but if she had never spoken a word, I would
            have gone with the little child to the end of the world.</p>
        <p>The next thing, and before we had well <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0"
                >stilled</scary_word> our sobs, the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >executors</scary_word> and guardians came to settle the affairs. They were my
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> young mistress's own cousin,
                <character ref="lordFurnivall">Lord Furnivall</character>, and Mr. Esthwaite, my
            master's brother, a shopkeeper in Manchester; not so well to do then as he was
            afterwards, and with a large family rising about him. Well! I don't know if it were
            their settling, or because of a letter my mistress wrote on her death-bed to her cousin,
            my lord; but somehow it was settled that Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character> and me were to go to Furnivall Manor <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="0">House</scary_word>, in Northumberland, and my lord spoke as if it had been
            her mother's wish that she should live with his family, and as if he had no objections,
            for that one or two more or less could make no difference in so grand a household. So,
            though that was not the way in which I should have wished the coming of my bright and
            pretty pet to have been looked at—who was like a sunbeam in any family, be it never so
            grand—I was well pleased that all the folks in the Dale should stare and admire, when
            they heard I was going to be young lady's maid at my <character ref="lordFurnivall">Lord
                Furnivall</character>'s at Furnivall Manor.</p>
        <p>But I made a mistake in thinking we were to go and live where my lord did. It turned out
            that the family had left Furnivall Manor <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >House</scary_word> fifty years or more. I could not hear that my <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> young mistress had never been there, though
            she had been brought up in the family; and I was sorry for that, for I should have liked
            Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>'s youth to have passed where her
            mother's had been.</p>
        <p>My lord's gentleman, from whom I asked as many questions as I durst, said that the Manor
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">House</scary_word> was at the foot of the
            Cumberland Fells, and a <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> grand place;
            that an old Miss Furnivall, a great-aunt of my lord's, lived there, with only a few
            servants; but that it was a <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> healthy
            place, and my lord had thought that it would suit Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character>
            <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> well for a few years, and that her
            being there might perhaps amuse his old aunt.</p>
        <p>I was bidden by my lord to have Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>'s
            things ready by a certain day. He was a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >stern</scary_word>, proud man, as they say all the Lords Furnivall were; and he
            never spoke a word more than was necessary. Folk did say he had loved my young mistress;
            but that, because she knew that his father would object, she would never listen to him,
            and married Mr. Esthwaite; but I don't know. He never married, at any rate. But he never
            took much notice of Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>; which I
            thought he might have done if he had cared for her <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >dead</scary_word> mother. He sent his gentleman with us to the Manor <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="0">House</scary_word>, telling him to join him at Newcastle that
            same <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">evening</scary_word>; so there was no great length
            of time for him to make us known to all the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >strangers</scary_word> before he, too, shook us off; and we were left, two
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">lonely</scary_word> young things (I was not
            eighteen) in the great old Manor <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">House</scary_word>. It
            seems like yesterday that we drove there. We had left our own dear parsonage <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> early, and we had both cried as if our hearts
            would break, though we were travelling in my lord's carriage, which I thought so much of
            once. And now it was long past noon on a September day, and we stopped to change horses
            for the last time at a little <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">smoky</scary_word> town,
            all full of colliers and miners. Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>
            had fallen asleep, but Mr. <character ref="mrHenry">Henry</character> told me to waken
            her, that she might see the park and the Manor <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >House</scary_word> as we drove up. I thought it rather a pity; but I did what he
            bade me, for <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">fear</scary_word> he should complain of me
            to my lord. We had left all signs of a town, or even a village, and were then inside the
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">gates</scary_word> of a large <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">wild</scary_word> park—not like the parks here in the south, but with
            rocks, and the noise of running water, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >gnarled</scary_word> thorn-<scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">trees</scary_word>, and
            old oaks, all <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">white</scary_word> and peeled with
            age.</p>
        <p>The road went up about two miles, and then we saw a great and stately <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">house</scary_word>, with many <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >trees</scary_word> close around it, so close that in some places their branches
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">dragged</scary_word> against the walls when the
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">wind</scary_word> blew; and some <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="1">hung</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">broken</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word>; for no one seemed to take much charge
            of the place;—to lop the wood, or to keep the moss-covered carriage-way in order. Only
            in front of the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">house</scary_word> all was clear. The
            great oval drive was without a weed; and neither tree nor <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="1">creeper</scary_word> was allowed to grow over the long, <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="0">many-windowed</scary_word> front; at both sides of which a wing
            protected, which were each the ends of other side fronts; for the <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="0">house</scary_word>, although it was so <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >desolate</scary_word>, was even grander than I expected. Behind it rose the Fells;
            which seemed unenclosed and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">bare</scary_word> enough;
            and on the left hand of the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">house</scary_word>, as you
            stood facing it, was a little, old-fashioned flower-garden, as I found out afterwards. A
            door opened out upon it from the west front; it had been scooped out of the thick,
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dark</scary_word> wood for some old <character
                ref="ladyFurnivall">Lady Furnivall</character>; but the branches of the great
                forest-<scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">trees</scary_word> had grown and <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="2">overshadowed</scary_word> it again, and there were <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> few flowers that would live there at that
            time.</p>
        <p>When we drove up to the great front entrance, and went into the hall, I thought we would
            be <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">lost</scary_word>—it was so large, and vast and
            grand. There was a chandelier all of bronze, <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0"
                >hung</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> from the middle of the ceiling; and I
            had never seen one before, and looked at it all in amaze. Then, at one end of the hall,
            was a great <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">fire</scary_word>-place, as large as the
            sides of the houses in my country, with <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >massy</scary_word> andirons and dogs to hold the wood; and by it were <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="0">heavy</scary_word>, old-fashioned sofas. At the opposite end of
            the hall, to the left as you went in—on the western side—was an organ built into the
            wall, and so large that it filled up the best part of that end. Beyond it, on the same
            side, was a door; and opposite, on each side of the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >fire</scary_word>-place, were also doors leading to the east front; but those I
            never went through as long as I stayed in the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >house</scary_word>, so I can't tell you what lay beyond.</p>
        <p>The afternoon was closing in, and the hall, which had no <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >fire</scary_word> lighted in it, looked <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >dark</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">gloomy</scary_word>, but we
            did not stay there a moment. The old servant, who had opened the door for us, bowed to
            Mr. <character ref="mrHenry">Henry</character>, and took us in through the door at the
            further side of the great organ, and led us through several smaller halls and passages
            into the west drawing-room, where he said that <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character> was sitting. <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">Poor</scary_word>
            little Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> held <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> tight to me, as if she were <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">scared</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >lost</scary_word> in that great place; and as for myself, I was not much better.
            The west drawing-room was <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word>
            cheerful-looking, with a warm <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">fire</scary_word> in it,
            and plenty of good, comfortable furniture about. <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character> was an old lady not far from eighty, I should think, but I do
            not know. She was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">thin</scary_word> and <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">tall</scary_word>, and had a face as full of fine <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">wrinkles</scary_word> as if they had been drawn all over it
            with a needle's point. Her <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">eyes</scary_word> were
                <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> watchful, to make up, I suppose,
            for her being so deaf as to be obliged to use a trumpet. Sitting with her, working at
            the same great piece of tapestry, was Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character>,
            her maid and companion, and almost as old as she was. She had lived with <character
                ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> ever since they both were young, and
            now she seemed more like a friend than a servant; she looked so <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">cold</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">grey</scary_word>,
            and stony, as if she had never loved or cared for any one; and I don't suppose she did
            care for any one, except her mistress; and, owing to the great deafness of the latter,
            Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> treated her <scary_word pos="mod"
                scale="i">very</scary_word> much as if she were a child. Mr. <character
                ref="mrHenry">Henry</character> gave some message from my lord, and then he bowed
            good-by to us all,—taking no notice of my sweet little Miss <character
                ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>'s outstretched hand—and left us standing
            there, being looked at by the two old ladies through their spectacles.</p>
        <p>I was right glad when they rung for the old footman who had shown us in at first, and
            told him to take us to our rooms. So we went out of that great drawing-room and into
            another sitting-room, and out of that, and then up a great flight of stairs, and along a
            broad gallery—which was something like a library, having books all <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="0">down</scary_word> one side, and <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                >windows</scary_word> and writing-tables all <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >down</scary_word> the other—till we came to our rooms, which I was not sorry to
            hear were just over the kitchens; for I began to think I should be <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="2">lost</scary_word> in that <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >wilderness</scary_word> of a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">house</scary_word>.
            There was an old nursery, that had been used for all the little lords and ladies long
            ago, with a pleasant <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">fire</scary_word> burning in the
            grate, and the kettle boiling on the hob, and tea-things spread out on the table; and
            out of that room was the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>-nursery,
            with a little crib for Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> close to
            my bed. And old <character ref="james">James</character> called up <character
                ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character>, his wife, to bid us welcome; and both he and she
            were so hospitable and kind, that by-and-by Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character> and me felt <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">quite</scary_word>
            at home; and by the time tea was over, she was sitting on <character ref="dorothy"
                >Dorothy</character>'s knee, and chattering away as fast as her little tongue could
            go. I soon found out that <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> was from
            Westmoreland, and that bound her and me together, as it were; and I would never wish to
            meet with kinder people than were old <character ref="james">James</character> and his
            wife. <character ref="james">James</character> had lived pretty nearly all his life in
            my lord's family, and thought there was no one so grand as they. He even looked
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> a little on his wife; because,
            till he had married her, she had never lived in any but a farmer's household. But he was
                <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> fond of her, as well he might be.
            They had one servant under them, to do all the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >rough</scary_word> work. <character ref="agnes">Agnes</character> they called her;
            and she and me, and <character ref="james">James</character> and <character
                ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character>, with <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character> and Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character>, made up
            the family; always remembering my sweet little Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character>! I used to wonder what they had done before she came, they
            thought so much of her now. Kitchen and drawing-room, it was all the same. The hard,
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">sad</scary_word>
            <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character>, and the <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">cold</scary_word> Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character>, looked
            pleased when she came fluttering in like a bird, playing and pranking hither and
            thither, with a continual murmur, and pretty prattle of gladness. I am sure, they were
            sorry many a time when she flitted away into the kitchen, though they were too proud to
            ask her to stay with them, and were a little surprised at her taste; though to be sure,
            as Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> said, it was not to be wondered at,
            remembering what stock her father had come of. The great, old rambling <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">house</scary_word> was a famous place for little Miss
                <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>. She made expeditions all over
            it, with me at her heels; all, except the east wing, which was never opened, and whither
            we never thought of going. But in the western and northern part was many a pleasant
            room; full of things that were curiosities to us, though they might not have been to
            people who had seen more. The <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">windows</scary_word> were
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">darkened</scary_word> by the sweeping boughs of the
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">trees</scary_word>, and the ivy which had overgrown
            them; but, in the green <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">gloom</scary_word>, we could
            manage to see old china jars and carved ivory boxes, and great <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">heavy</scary_word> books, and, above all, the old pictures!</p>
        <p>Once, I remember, my darling would have <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> go
            with us to tell us who they all were; for they were all portraits of some of my lord's
            family, though <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> could not tell us the names
            of every one. We had gone through most of the rooms, when we came to the old state
            drawing-room over the hall, and there was a picture of <character ref="missFurnivall"
                >Miss Furnivall</character>; or, as she was called in those days, Miss <character
                ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>, for she was the younger sister. Such a beauty
            she must have been! but with such a set, proud look, and such <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="1">scorn</scary_word> looking out of her handsome <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="1">eyes</scary_word>, with her eyebrows just a little raised, as if she
            wondered how anyone could have the impertinence to look at her, and her lip curled at
            us, as we stood there gazing. She had a dress on, the like of which I had never seen
            before, but it was all the fashion when she was young; a hat of some soft <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="0">white</scary_word> stuff like beaver, pulled a little over her
            brows, and a beautiful plume of feathers sweeping round it on one side; and her gown of
            blue satin was open in front to a quilted <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >white</scary_word> stomacher.</p>
        <p><speech ref="hester">'Well, to be sure!'</speech> said I, when I had gazed my fill.
                '<scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">flesh</scary_word> is <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="1">grass</scary_word>, they do say; but who would have thought that
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> had been such an
            out-and-out beauty, to see her now.'</p>
        <p><speech ref="dorothy">'Yes,'</speech> said <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character>.
                <speech ref="dorothy">'Folks change <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1"
                    >sadly</scary_word>. But if what my master's father used to say was true,
                    <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character>, the elder sister, was
                handsomer than Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>. Her picture is
                here somewhere; but, if I show it you, you must never let on, even to <character
                    ref="james">James</character>, that you have seen it. Can the little lady hold
                her tongue, think you?'</speech> asked she.</p>
        <p>I was not so sure, for she was such a little sweet, bold, open-spoken child, so I set her
            to hide herself; and then I helped <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> to turn
            a great picture, that leaned with its face towards the wall, and was not <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="1">hung</scary_word> up as the others were. To be sure, it beat
            Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> for beauty; and, I think, for
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">scornful</scary_word> pride, too, though in that
            matter it might be hard to choose. I could have looked at it an hour, but <character
                ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> seemed half <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                >frightened</scary_word> at having shown it to me, and hurried it back again, and
            bade me run and find Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>, for that
            there were some ugly places about the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >house</scary_word>, where she should like <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >ill</scary_word> for the child to go. I was a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >brave</scary_word>, high-spirited girl, and thought little of what the old woman
            said, for I liked hide-and-seek as well as any child in the parish; so off I ran to find
            my little one.</p>
        <p>As <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">winter</scary_word> drew on, and the days grew
            shorter, I was sometimes almost certain that <scary_phrase>I heard a noise as if someone
                was playing on the great organ in the hall</scary_phrase>. I did not hear it every
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">evening</scary_word>; but, certainly, I did
                <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> often, usually when I was sitting
            with Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character>, after I had put her to
            bed, and keeping <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">quite</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">still</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >silent</scary_word> in the bedroom. Then I used to hear it <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">booming</scary_word> and swelling away in the distance. The first
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">night</scary_word>, when I went <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> to my supper, I asked <character ref="dorothy"
                >Dorothy</character> who had been playing music, and <character ref="james"
                >James</character> said <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> shortly
            that I was a gowk to take the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">wind</scary_word>
            soughing among the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">trees</scary_word> for music; but I
            saw <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> look at him <scary_word pos="mod"
                scale="i">very</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">fearfully</scary_word>, and <character ref="bessy"
                >Bessy</character>, the kitchen-maid, said something beneath her breath, and went
                <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">quite</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">white</scary_word>. I saw they did not like my question,
            so I held my peace till I was with <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">alone</scary_word>, when I knew I could get a good deal
            out of her. So, the next day, I watched my time, and I coaxed and asked her who it was
            that played the organ; for I knew that it was the organ and not the <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">wind</scary_word> well enough, for all I had kept silence
            before <character ref="james">James</character>. But <character ref="dorothy"
                >Dorothy</character> had had her lesson, I'll warrant, and never a word could I get
            from her. So then I tried <character ref="bessy">Bessy</character>, though I had always
            held my head rather above her, as I was evened to <character ref="james"
                >James</character> and <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character>, and she was
            little better than their servant. So she said I must never, never tell; and if ever I
            told, I was never to say she had told me; but it was a <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i"
                >very</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">strange</scary_word> noise, and she had heard it many a
            time, but most of all on <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">winter</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">nights</scary_word>, and before storms; and folks did
            say it was the old lord playing on the great organ in the hall, just as he used to do
            when he was alive; but who the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> was, or why
            he played, and why he played on <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">stormy</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">winter</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">evenings</scary_word> in particular, she either could
            not or would not tell me. Well! I told you I had a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >brave</scary_word> heart; and I thought it was rather pleasant to have that grand
            music rolling about the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">house</scary_word>, let who
            would be the player; for now it rose above the great gusts of <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="2">wind</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >wailed</scary_word> and triumphed just like a living creature, and then it fell to
            a softness most complete, only it was always music, and tunes, so it was nonsense to
            call it the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">wind</scary_word>. I thought at first, that
            it might be <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> who played,
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">unknown</scary_word> to <character ref="bessy"
                >Bessy</character>; but one day, when I was in the hall by myself, I opened the
            organ and peeped all about it and around it, as I had done to the organ in Crosthwaite
            church once before, and I saw it was all <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                >broken</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">destroyed</scary_word>
            inside, though it looked so <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">brave</scary_word> and fine;
            and then, though it was noon-day, my <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">flesh</scary_word>
            began to <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3">creep</scary_word> a little, and I shut it up,
            and run away pretty quickly to my own bright nursery; and I did not like hearing the
            music for some time after that, any more than <character ref="james">James</character>
            and <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> did. All this time Miss <character
                ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> was making herself more and more beloved.
            The old ladies liked her to dine with them at their early dinner. <character ref="james"
                >James</character> stood behind <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character>'s chair, and I behind Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character>'s all in state; and after dinner, she would play about in a
            corner of the great drawing-room as <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">still</scary_word>
            as any mouse, while <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> slept, and
            I had my dinner in the kitchen. But she was glad enough to come to me in the nursery
            afterwards; for, as she said, <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character>
            was so <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">sad</scary_word>, and Mrs. <character
                ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> so <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >dull</scary_word>; but she and I were merry enough; and by-and-by, I got not to
            care for that weird rolling music, which did one no harm, if we did not know where it
            came from.</p>
        <p>That <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">winter</scary_word> was <scary_word pos="mod"
                scale="i">very</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">cold</scary_word>. In the middle of October the frosts
            began, and lasted many, many weeks. I remember one day, at dinner, <character
                ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> lifted up her <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">sad</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">heavy</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">eyes</scary_word>, and said to Mrs. <character
                ref="mrsStark">Stark</character>, <speech ref="missFurnivall">'I am <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="2">afraid</scary_word> we shall have a <scary_word pos="adj"

                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">winter</scary_word>,'</speech> in a <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">strange</scary_word> kind of meaning way. But Mrs. <character
                ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> pretended not to hear, and talked <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> loud of something else. My little lady and I
            did not care for the frost; not we! As long as it was dry, we climbed up the steep brows
            behind the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">house</scary_word>, and went up on the
            Fells, which were bleak and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">bare</scary_word> enough,
            and there we ran races in the fresh, sharp <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >air</scary_word>; and once we came <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >down</scary_word> by a new path, that took us past the two old <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">gnarled</scary_word> holly-<scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >trees</scary_word>, which grew about half-way <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >down</scary_word> by the east side of the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                >house</scary_word>. But the days grew shorter and shorter, and the <character
                ref="oldLord">old lord</character>, if it was he, played away, more and more
                <scary_word pos="adv" scale="3">stormily</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adv"
                scale="3">sadly</scary_word>, on the great organ. One Sunday afternoon—it must have
            been towards the end of <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">November</scary_word>—I asked
                <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> to take charge of little missy when she
            came out of the drawing-room, after Miss Furnivall had had her nap; for it was too
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">cold</scary_word> to take her with me to church, and
            yet I wanted to go. And <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> was glad enough to
            promise, and was so fond of the child, that all seemed well; and <character ref="bessy"
                >Bessy</character> and I set off <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word>
            briskly, though the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">sky</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">hung</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">heavy</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >black</scary_word> over the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">white</scary_word>
            earth, as if the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">night</scary_word> had never fully
            gone away, and the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">air</scary_word>, though <scary_word

                >very</scary_word> biting and keen.</p>
        <p><speech ref="bessy">'We shall have a fall of snow,'</speech> said <character ref="bessy"
                >Bessy</character> to me. And sure enough, even while we were in church, it came
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> thick, in great large flakes,—so
            thick, it almost <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">darkened</scary_word> the <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="2">windows</scary_word>. It had stopped snowing before we came
            out, but it lay soft, thick and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">deep</scary_word>
            beneath our feet, as we tramped home. Before we got to the hall, the moon rose, and I
            think it was lighter then—what with the moon, and what with the <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">white</scary_word> dazzling snow—than it had been when we went to church,
            between two and three o'clock. I have not told you that <character ref="missFurnivall"
                >Miss Furnivall</character> and Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character>
            never went to church; they used to read the prayers together, in their quiet,
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">gloomy</scary_word> way; they seemed to feel the
            Sunday <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> long without their
            tapestry-work to be busy at. So when I went to <character ref="dorothy"
                >Dorothy</character> in the kitchen, to fetch Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character> and take her upstairs with me, I did not much wonder when the
            old woman told me that the ladies had kept the child with them, and that she had never
            come to the kitchen, as I had bidden her, when she was tired of behaving pretty in the
            drawing-room. So I took off my things and went to find her, and bring her to her supper
            in the nursery. But when I went into the best drawing-room, there sat the two old
            ladies, <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">still</scary_word> and quiet, dropping out a word now
            and then, but looking as if nothing so bright and merry as Miss <character
                ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> had ever been near them. <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">still</scary_word> I thought she might be hiding from me; it was
            one of her pretty ways,—and that she had persuaded them to look as if they knew nothing
            about her; so I went softly peeping under this sofa, and behind that chair, making
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">believe</scary_word> I was <scary_word pos="adv"
                scale="0">sadly</scary_word>

        <p>My heart sank at this, and I began to wish I had never left my darling. I went back to

        <p>But <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> said it was not possible, for that she

            at any rate, neither she nor <character ref="james">James</character> had ever seen

            and I told Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> we could not find her
            anywhere, and asked for leave to look all about the furniture there, for I thought now

            was found. Well-a-day! I began to think she never would be found, when I bethought me to
            look into the great front court, all covered with snow. I was upstairs when I looked

            Then, Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> hurried me out of the room;
            where, indeed, I was glad enough to go; but <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character> kept <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3" synset="shriek.v.01"
                >shrieking</scary_word> out, <speech ref="missFurnivall">'Oh, have mercy! Wilt Thou

        <p>I was <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i" synset="very.r.01">very</scary_word> uneasy in my
            mind after that. I durst never leave Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character>, <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1" synset="night.n.01"
                >night</scary_word> or day, for <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2" synset="fear.n.01"
                >fear</scary_word> lest she might slip off again, after some fancy or other; and all
            the more, because I thought I could make out that <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character> was crazy, from their odd ways about her; and I was
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2" synset="afraid.a.01">afraid</scary_word> lest
            something of the same kind (which might be in the family, you know) <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="1" synset="hang.v.06">hung</scary_word> over my darling. And the
            great frost never ceased all this time; and, whenever it was a more <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2" synset="stormy.a.01">stormy</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2" synset="night.n.01">night</scary_word> than usual,
            between the gusts, and through the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2" synset="wind.n.01"
                >wind</scary_word>, we heard the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character>
            playing on the great organ. But, <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character>, or not,
            wherever Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> went, there I followed;
            for my love for her, pretty, helpless orphan, was stronger than my <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="2" synset="fear.n.01">fear</scary_word> for the grand and
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3" synset="awful.s.02">terrible</scary_word> sound.
            Besides, it rested with me to keep her cheerful and merry, as beseemed her age. So we
            played together, and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1" synset="wander.v.03"
                >wandered</scary_word> together, here and there, and everywhere; for I never dared
            to lose sight of her again in that large and rambling <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                synset="house.n.01">house</scary_word>. And so it happened, that one afternoon, not
            long before <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0" synset="christmas.n.02"
                >Christmas</scary_word>-day, we were playing together on the billiard-table in the
            great hall (not that we knew the right way of playing, but she liked to roll the smooth
            ivory balls with her pretty hands, and I liked to do whatever she did); and, by-and-by,
            without our noticing it, it grew <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1" synset="twilight.n.01"
                >dusk</scary_word> indoors, though it was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"

                scale="0" synset="air.n.01">air</scary_word>, and I was thinking of taking her back
            into the nursery, when, all of a sudden, she cried out,</p>
        <p>
            <speech ref="missRosamond">'Look, <character ref="hester">Hester</character>! look!

        </p>
        <p>I turned towards the long narrow <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2" synset="window.n.01"
                >windows</scary_word>, and there, sure enough, I saw a <character ref="ghost">little

            a sudden, and close upon us, <scary_phrase>the great organ pealed out so loud and

            Whether I remembered all this at the <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i" synset="very.s.01">very</scary_word>
            moment, I do not know; the great organ sound had so stunned me into <scary_word

            where, if we lived humbly, we lived at peace. I said I had been <scary_word pos="adj"

            <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3" synset="groan.v.01">moaning</scary_word> child, all decked out as no
            child in the neighbourhood could be, <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3" synset="beat.v.03"

                >dark</scary_word> wound on its right shoulder; and that Miss <character

        <p>I saw <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> change colour once or twice. When I
            had done, she told me she did not think I could take Miss <character ref="missRosamond"
                >Rosamond</character> with me, for that she was my lord's ward, and I had no right
            over her; and she asked me would I leave the child that I was so fond of just for sounds
            and sights that could do me no harm; and that they had all had to get used to in their
            turns? I was all in a hot, <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2" synset="tremble.v.01">trembling</scary_word>
            passion; and I said it was <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i" synset="very.r.01">very</scary_word> well for
            her to talk; that knew what these sights and noises betokened, and that had, perhaps,
            had something to do with the spectre child while it was alive. And I taunted her so,
            that she told me all she knew at last; and then I wished I had never been told, for it
            only made me more <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2" synset="afraid.a.01">afraid</scary_word> than ever.</p>
        <plot point="history"/>
        <p>She said she had heard the tale from old neighbours that were alive when she was first
            married; when folks used to come to the hall sometimes, before it had got such a
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">bad</scary_word> name on the country side: it might
            not be true, or it might, what she had been told.</p>
        <p>The <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> was <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss
                Furnivall</character>'s father—Miss <character ref="missFurnivall"
            >Grace</character>, as <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> called her, for Miss
                <character ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> was the elder, and <character
                ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> by rights. The <character
                ref="oldLord">old lord</character> was eaten up with pride. Such a proud man was
            never seen or heard of; and his daughters were like him. No one was good enough to wed
            them, although they had choice enough; for they were the great beauties of their day, as
            I had seen by their portraits, where they <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0"
                >hung</scary_word> in the state drawing-room. But, as the old saying is, 'Pride will
            have a fall;' and these two haughty beauties fell in love with the same man, and he no
            better than a <character ref="secretHusband">foreign musician</character>, whom their
            father had <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> from London to play music
            with him at the Manor <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">House</scary_word>. For, above
            all things, next to his pride, the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> loved
            music. He could play on nearly every instrument that ever was heard of, and it was a
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">strange</scary_word> thing it did not soften him;
            but he was a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">fierce</scary_word> dour old man, and had
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">broken</scary_word> his <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">poor</scary_word> wife's heart with his <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >cruelty</scary_word>, they said. He was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >mad</scary_word> after music, and would pay any money for it. So he got this
                <character ref="secretHusband">foreigner</character> to come; who made such
            beautiful music, that they said the <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word>
            birds on the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">trees</scary_word> stopped their singing
            to listen. And, by degrees, this <character ref="secretHusband">foreign
                gentleman</character> got such a hold over the <character ref="oldLord">old
                lord</character>, that nothing would serve him but that he must come every year; and
            it was he that had the great organ brought from Holland, and built up in the hall, where
            it stood now. He taught the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> to play on it;
            but many and many a time, when <character ref="lordFurnivall">Lord Furnivall</character>
            was thinking of nothing but his fine organ, and his finer music, the <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">dark</scary_word>
            <character ref="secretHusband">foreigner</character> was walking abroad in the woods
            with one of the young ladies; now Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall"
            >Maude</character>, and then Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>.</p>
        <p>Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> won the day and carried off the
            prize, such as it was; and he and she were married, all <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                >unknown</scary_word> to any one; and before he made his next yearly visit, she had
            been confined of a <character ref="ghost">little girl</character> at a farm-<scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="0">house</scary_word> on the Moors, while her father and Miss
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> thought she was away at Doncaster
            Races. But though she was a wife and a mother, she was not a bit softened, but as
            haughty and as passionate as ever; and perhaps more so, for she was jealous of Miss
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>, to whom her <character
                ref="secretHusband">foreign husband</character> paid a deal of court—by way of
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">blinding</scary_word> her—as he told his wife. But
            Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> triumphed over Miss <character
                ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character>, and Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall"
                >Maude</character> grew <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">fiercer</scary_word> and
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">fiercer</scary_word>, both with her <character
                ref="secretHusband">husband</character> and with her sister; and the former—who
            could easily shake off what was disagreeable, and hide himself in foreign countries—went
            away a month before his usual time that summer, and half-threatened that he would never
            come back again. Meanwhile, the <character ref="ghost">little girl</character> was left
            at the farm-<scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">house</scary_word>, and her mother used to
            have her horse saddled and gallop <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">wildly</scary_word>
            over the hills to see her once every week, at the <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i"
                >very</scary_word> least; for where she loved she loved, and where she <scary_word
                pos="verb" scale="2">hated</scary_word> she <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >hated</scary_word>. And the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> went on
            playing—playing on his organ; and the servants thought the sweet music he made had
            soothed <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> his <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">awful</scary_word> temper, of which (<character ref="dorothy"
                >Dorothy</character> said) some <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                >terrible</scary_word> tales could be told. He grew infirm too, and had to walk with
            a crutch; and his son—that was the present <character ref="lordFurnivall">Lord
                Furnivall</character>'s father—was with the army in America, and the other son at
            sea; so Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> had it pretty much her
            own way, and she and Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> grew
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">colder</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">bitterer</scary_word> to each other every day; till at last they hardly
            ever spoke, except when the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> was by. The
                <character ref="secretHusband">foreign musician</character> came again the next
            summer, but it was for the last time; for they led him such a life with their jealousy
            and their passions, that he grew <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">weary</scary_word>, and
            went away, and never was heard of again. And Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall"
                >Maude</character>, who had always meant to have her marriage acknowledged when her
            father should be <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dead</scary_word>, was left now a
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">deserted</scary_word> wife, whom nobody knew to have
            been married, with a child that she dared not own, although she loved it to distraction;
            living with a father whom she <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">feared</scary_word>, and
            a sister whom she <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">hated</scary_word>. When the next
            summer passed over, and the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dark</scary_word>
            <character ref="secretHusband">foreigner</character> never came, both Miss <character
                ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> and Miss <character ref="missFurnivall"
                >Grace</character> grew <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">gloomy</scary_word> and
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">sad</scary_word>; they had a <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">haggard</scary_word> look about them, though they looked handsome as ever.
            But, by-and-by, <character ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> brightened; for her
            father grew more and more infirm, and more than ever carried away by his music; and she
            and Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> lived almost entirely apart,
            having separate rooms, the one on the west side, Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall"
                >Maude</character> on the east—those <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i"
                >very</scary_word> rooms which were now shut up. So she thought she might have her
                <character ref="ghost">little girl</character> with her, and no one need ever know
            except those who dared not speak about it, and were bound to <scary_word pos="verb"
                scale="0">believe</scary_word> that it was, as she said, a cottager's child she had
            taken a fancy to. All this, <character ref="dorothy">Dorothy</character> said, was
            pretty well known; but what came afterwards no one knew, except Miss <character
                ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> and Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark"
                >Stark</character>, who was even then her maid, and much more of a friend to her
            than ever her sister had been. But the servants supposed, from words that were dropped,
            that Miss <character ref="maudeFurnivall">Maude</character> had triumphed over Miss
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>, and told her that all the time the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dark</scary_word>
            <character ref="secretHusband">foreigner</character> had been mocking her with pretended
            love—he was her own <character ref="secretHusband">husband</character>. The colour left
            Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character>'s cheek and lips that <scary_word
                pos="mod" scale="i">very</scary_word> day for ever, and she was heard to say many a
            time that sooner or later she would have her <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >revenge</scary_word>; and Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> was for
            ever spying about the east rooms.</p>
        <p>One <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">fearful</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">night</scary_word>, just after the New Year had come
            in, when the snow was lying thick and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">deep</scary_word>;
            and the flakes were <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">still</scary_word> falling—fast
            enough to <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">blind</scary_word> any one who might be out
            and abroad—there was a great and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">violent</scary_word>
            noise heard, and the <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character>'s voice above all,
            cursing and swearing <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">awfully</scary_word>, and the
                    <scary_phrase><scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">cries</scary_word> of a little
                child</scary_phrase>, and the proud <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                >defiance</scary_word> of a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">fierce</scary_word>
            woman, and the sound of a blow, and a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">dead</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">stillness</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="noun"

                >wailings</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3">dying</scary_word> away on the hill-side! Then the
                <character ref="oldLord">old lord</character> summoned all his servants, and told
            them, with <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">terrible</scary_word> oaths, and words more
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">terrible</scary_word>, that his daughter had
            disgraced herself, and that he had turned her out of doors—her, and her child—and that
            if ever they gave her help, or food, or shelter, he prayed that they might never enter
            heaven. And, all the while, Miss <character ref="missFurnivall">Grace</character> stood
            by him, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">white</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="3">still</scary_word> as any stone; and, when he had ended, she heaved a
            great sigh, as much as to say her work was done, and her end was accomplished. But the

        <p>I was more <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">frightened</scary_word> than ever; but I said
            I was not. I wished Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> and myself
            well out of that <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dreadful</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">house</scary_word> for ever; but I would not leave her,
            and I dared not take her away. But oh, how I watched her, and guarded her! We bolted the
            doors, and shut the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">window</scary_word>-<scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="1">shutters</scary_word> fast, an hour or more before <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="2">dark</scary_word>, rather than leave them open five minutes too
            late. But my little lady <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">still</scary_word> heard the
            weird child <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3">crying</scary_word> and <scary_word
                pos="noun" scale="3">mourning</scary_word>; and not all we could do or say could
            keep her from wanting to go to her, and let her in from the <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="2">cruel</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">wind</scary_word> and the snow. All this time I kept
            away from <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> and Mrs. <character

            with their <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">grey</scary_word>, hard faces, and their
            dreamy <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">eyes</scary_word>, looking back into the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">ghastly</scary_word> years that were gone. But, even
            in my <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">fear</scary_word>, I had a kind of pity for
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character>, at least. Those gone
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">down</scary_word> to the pit can hardly have a more
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">hopeless</scary_word> look than that which was ever
            on her face. At last I even got so sorry for her—who never said a word but what was
                <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i">quite</scary_word> forced from her—that I prayed for
            her; and I taught Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> to pray for
            one who had done a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">deadly</scary_word> sin; but often
            when she came to those words, she would listen, and start up from her knees, and say,

        <p>One <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>—just after New Year's Day had

            taken a turn, as I hoped—I heard the west drawing-room bell ring three times, which was
            the signal for me. I would not leave Miss <character ref="missRosamond"

            <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">alone</scary_word>, for all she was asleep—for the old

            too well for that. So I took her out of her bed, and wrapped her up in such outer

                >down</scary_word> to the drawing-room, where the old ladies sat at their

            Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> looked at me, and I at her, but we

            towards the door, out into the ante-room, through the west lobby, and opened the door
            into the great hall. Mrs. <character ref="mrsStark">Stark</character> followed, and I
            durst not be left, though my heart almost stopped beating for <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="3">fear</scary_word>. I wrapped my darling tight in my arms, and went out
            with them. In the hall the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">screams</scary_word> were
            louder than ever; they seemed to come from the east wing—nearer and nearer—close on the

            behind them. Then I noticed that the great bronze chandelier seemed all alight, though
            the hall was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dim</scary_word>, and that a <scary_word

        <p>Again she was almost convulsed by her efforts to get away; but I held her tighter and
            tighter, till I <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">feared</scary_word> I should do her a
            hurt; but rather that than let her go towards those <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                >terrible</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">phantoms</scary_word>. They passed along towards the

            <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3">howled</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="verb"

                >prey</scary_word>; but before they reached that, the <character

                >fierce</scary_word> and proud <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"

                >quailed</scary_word>—and then she threw up her arms <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2"
                >wildly</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">piteously</scary_word> to
            save her <character ref="ghost">child</character>—her little child—from a blow from his
            uplifted crutch.</p>
        <p>And Miss <character ref="missRosamond">Rosamond</character> was torn as by a power
            stronger than mine and writhed in my arms, and sobbed (for by this time the <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="1">poor</scary_word> darling was growing <scary_word pos="adj"

        <p><speech ref="missRosamond">'They want me to go with them on to the Fells—they are drawing

            swooned away, and I thanked God for it. Just at this moment—when the <scary_word
                pos="adj" scale="2">tall</scary_word>
            <character ref="oldLord">old man</character>, his hair streaming as in the <scary_word

            But just then I saw—we all saw—another <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3"
                >phantom</scary_word> shape itself, and grow clear out of the blue and misty light
            that filled the hall; we had not seen her till now, for it was another lady who stood by
            the old man, with a look of <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">relentless</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">hate</scary_word> and triumphant <scary_word pos="noun"
                scale="3">scorn</scary_word>. That figure was <scary_word pos="mod" scale="i"
                >very</scary_word> beautiful to look upon, with a soft, <scary_word pos="adj"
                scale="1">white</scary_word> hat drawn <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0"
                >down</scary_word> over the proud brows, and a red and curling lip. It was dressed
            in an open robe of blue satin. I had seen that figure before. It was the likeness of
                <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> in her youth; and the
                <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">terrible</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">phantoms</scary_word> moved on, regardless of old

                scale="3">wild</scary_word>
            <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">entreaty</scary_word>,—and the uplifted crutch fell on
            the right shoulder of the <character ref="ghost">little child</character>, and the
            younger sister looked on, stony, and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">deadly</scary_word>
            serene. But at that moment, the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dim</scary_word> lights,
            and the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">fire</scary_word> that gave no heat, went out
            of themselves, and <character ref="missFurnivall">Miss Furnivall</character> lay at our
            feet stricken <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">down</scary_word> by the palsy—<scary_word

        <p>Yes! she was carried to her bed that <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">night</scary_word>
            never to rise again. She lay with her face to the wall, <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >muttering</scary_word> low, but <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                >muttering</scary_word> always: <speech ref="missFurnivall">'Alas! alas! what is
