            <p>Many a one who had before him trodden that same street must have uttered the same
                words—the weary, the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">desolate</scary_word>, the
                hungry, the forsaken, the waifs and strays of struggling humanity that are always
                coming and going, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">cold</scary_word>, starving and
                miserable, over the pavements of Lambeth Parish; but it is open to question whether
                they were ever previously spoken with a more thorough conviction of their truth, or
                with a feeling of keener self-pity, than by the young man who hurried along Vauxhall
                Walk one rainy winter's <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">night</scary_word>, with no
                overcoat on his shoulders and no hat on his head.</p>
            <plot point="intro"/>
            <p>A <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">strange</scary_word> sentence for one-and-twenty to
                give expression to—and it was stranger still to come from the lips of a person who
                looked like and who was a gentleman. He did not appear either to have sunk very far
                down in the good graces of Fortune. There was no sign or token which would have
                induced a passer-by to imagine he had been worsted after a long fight with calamity.
                His boots were not <scary_word pos="adv" scale="0">worn</scary_word> down at the
                heels or broken at the toes, as many, many boots were which dragged and shuffled and
                scraped along the pavement. His clothes were good and fashionably cut, and innocent
                of the rents and patches and tatters that <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1"
                    >slunk</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">wretchedly</scary_word> by, crouched in doorways,
                and held out a hand mutely appealing for charity. His face was not pinched with
                famine or lined with <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">wicked</scary_word> wrinkles,
                or brutalised by drink and debauchery, and yet he said and thought he was hopeless,
                and almost in his young <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">despair</scary_word> spoke
                the words aloud.</p>
            <p>It was a bad <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word> to be about with
                such a feeling in one's heart. The rain was <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >cold</scary_word>, pitiless and increasing. A damp, keen wind blew down the
                cross streets leading from the river. The fumes of the gas works seemed to
                    <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">fall</scary_word> with the rain. The roadway
                was muddy; the pavement greasy; the lamps burned <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1"
                    >dimly</scary_word>; and that <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >dreary</scary_word> district of London looked its very <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="1">gloomiest</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >worst</scary_word>.</p>
            <p>Certainly not an evening to be abroad without a home to go to, or a sixpence in one's
                pocket, yet this was the position of the young gentleman who, without a hat, strode
                along Vauxhall Walk, the rain beating on his unprotected head.</p>
            <p>Upon the houses, so large and good—once inhabited by well-to-do citizens, now let out
                for the most part in floors to weekly tenants—he looked enviously. He would have
                given much to have had a room, or even part of one. He had been walking for a long
                time, ever since <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">dark</scary_word> in fact, and
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">dark</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">falls</scary_word> soon in December. He was tired
                and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">cold</scary_word> and hungry, and he saw no
                prospect save of pacing the streets all <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                    >night</scary_word>.</p>
            <p>As he passed one of the lamps, the light <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0"
                    >falling</scary_word> on his face revealed hadsome young features, a mobile,
                sensitive mouth, and that particular formation of the eyebrows—not a frown exactly,
                but a certain draw of the brows—often considered to bespeak genius, but which more
                surely accompanies an impulsive organisation easily pleased, easily depressed,
                capable of suffering very keenly or of enjoying fully. In his short life he had not
                enjoyed much, and he had suffered a good deal. That <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                    >night</scary_word>, when he walked bareheaded through the rain, affairs had
                come to a crisis. So far as he in his <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                    >despair</scary_word> felt able to see or reason, the best thing he could do was
                to <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">die</scary_word>. The world did not want him; he
                would be better out of it.</p>
            <p>The door of one of the houses stood open, and he could see in the <scary_word
                    pos="adv" scale="1">dimly</scary_word> lighted hall some few articles of
                furniture waiting to be removed. A van stood beside the curb, and two men were
                lifting a table into it as he, for a second, paused.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Ah,</speech> he thought, <speech ref="grahamCoulton">even
                    those poor people have some place to go to, some shelter provided, while I have
                    not a roof to cover my head, or a shilling to get a <scary_word pos="noun"
                        scale="0">night</scary_word>'s lodging.</speech> And he went on fast,, as if
                memory were spurring him, so fast that a man running after had some trouble to
                overtake him.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william"><character ref="grahamCoulton">Master Graham</character>!
                        <character ref="grahamCoulton">Master Graham</character>!</speech> this man
                exclaimed, breathlessly; and, thus addressed, the young fellow stopped as if he had
                been shot.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Who are you that know me?</speech> he asked, facing
                round.</p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">I'm <character ref="william">William</character>; don't you
                    remember <character ref="william">William</character>, <character
                        ref="grahamCoulton">Master Graham</character>? And, Lord's sake, sir, what
                    are you doing out a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">night</scary_word> like
                    this without your hat?</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I forgot it,</speech> was the answer; <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">and I did not care to go back and fetch it.</speech></p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">Then why don't you buy another, sir? You'll catch your death
                    of <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">cold</scary_word>; and besides, you'll excuse
                    me, sir, but it does look odd.</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I know that,</speech> said Master Graham grimly; <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">but I haven't a halfpenny in the world.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="william">Have you and the master, then—</speech> began the man, but
                there he hesitated and stopped.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Had a quarrel? Yes, and one that will last us our
                    lives,</speech> finished the other, with a bitter laugh. <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">And where are you going now?</speech></p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">Going! Nowhere, except to seek out the softest paving stone,
                    or the shelter of an arch.</speech>
            </p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">You are joking, sir.</speech>
            </p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">I don't feel much in a mood for jesting either.</speech>
            </p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">Will you come back with me, <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                        >Master Graham</character>? We are just at the last of our moving, but there
                    is a spark of fire still in the grate, and it would be better talking out of
                    this rain. Will you come, sir?</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Come! Of course I will come,</speech> said the young
                fellow, and, turning, they retraced their steps to the house he had looked into as
                he passed along.</p>
            <p>An <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >old</scary_word> house, with long, wide hall, stairs low, easy of ascent, with
                deep cornices to the ceilings, and oak floorings, and mahogany doors, which still
                spoke mutely of the wealth and stability of the original owner, who lived before the
                Tradescants and Ashmoles were thought of, and had been sleeping far longer than
                they, in St Mary's churchyard, hard by the archbishop's palace.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william">Step upstairs, sir,</speech> entreated the departing tenant;
                    <speech ref="william">it's <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">cold</scary_word>
                    down here, with the door standing wide.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Had you the whole house, then, <character ref="william"
                        >William</character>?</speech> asked <character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham
                    Coulton</character>, in some surprise.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william">The whole of it, and right sorry I, for one, am to leave it;
                    but nothing else would serve my wife. This room, sir,</speech> and with a little
                conscious pride, <character ref="william">William</character>, doing the honours of
                his late residence, asked his guest into a spacious apartment occupying the full
                width of the house on the first floor.</p>
            <p>Tired though he was, the young man could not repress an exclamation of
                astonishment.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Why, we have nothing so large as this at home, <character
                        ref="william">William</character>,</speech> he said.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william">It's a fine house,</speech> answered <character ref="william"
                    >William</character>, raking the embers together as he spoke and throwing some
                wood upon them; <speech>but, like many a good family, it has come down in the
                    world.</speech></p>
            <p>There were four windows in the room, shuttered close; they had deep, low seats,
                suggestive of pleasant days gone by; when, well-curtained and well-cushioned, they
                formed snug retreats for the children, and sometimes for adults also; there was no
                furniture left, unless an oaken settle beside the hearth, and a large mirror let
                into the panelling at the opposite end of the apartment, with a black marble console
                table beneath it, could be so considered; but the very absence of chairs and tables
                enabled the magnificent proportions of the chamber to be seen to full advantage, and
                there wa Coultons nothing to distract the attention from the ornamented ceiling, the
                panelled walls, the old-world chimney-piece so quaintly carved, and the fireplace
                lined with tiles, each one of which contained a picture of some scriptural or
                allegorical subject.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Had you been staying on here, <character ref="william"
                        >William</character>,</speech> said <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                    >Coulton</character>, flinging himself wearily on the settle, <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">I'd have asked you to let me stop where I am for the
                        <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">night</scary_word>.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="william">If you can make shift, sir, there is nothing as I am aware of
                    to prevent you stopping,</speech> answered the man, fanning the wood into a
                flame. <speech ref="william">I shan't take the key back to the landlord till
                    tomorrow, and this would be better for you than the <scary_word pos="adj"
                        scale="0">cold</scary_word> streets at any rate.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Do you really mean what you say?</speech> asked the other
                eagerly. <speech ref="grahamCoulton">I should be thankful to lie here; I feel dead
                    beat.</speech></p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">Then stay, <character ref="grahamCoulton">Master
                        Graham</character>, and welcome. I'll fetch a basket of coals I was going to
                    put in the van, and make up a good fire, so that you can warm yourself then I
                    must run round to the other house for a minute or two, but it's not far, and
                    I'll be back as soon as ever I can.</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Thank you, <character ref="william">William</character>;
                    you were always good to me,</speech> said the young man gratefully. <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">This is delightful,</speech> and he stretched his numbed
                hands over the blazing wood, and looked round the room with a satisfied smile.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I did not expect to get into such quarters,</speech> he
                remarked, as his friend in need reappeared, carrying a half-bushel basket full of
                coals, with which he proceeded to make up a roaring fire. <speech
                    ref="grahamCoulton">I am sure the last thing I could have imagined was meeting
                    with anyone I knew in Vauxhall Walk.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="william">Where were you coming from, <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                        >Master Graham</character>?</speech> asked <character ref="william"
                    >William</character> curiously.</p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">From <scary_word pos="adj" scale="0">old</scary_word>
                    Melfield's. I was at his school once, you know, and he has now retired, and is
                    living upon the proceeds of years of robbery in Kennington Oval. I thought,
                    perhaps he would lend me a pound, or offer me a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                        >night</scary_word>'s lodging, or even a glass of wine; but, oh dear, no. He
                    took the moral tone, and observed he could have nothing to say to a son who
                    defied his father's authority. He gave me plenty of advice, but nothing else,
                    and showed me out into the rain with a bland courtesy, for which I could have
                    struck him.</speech>
            </p>
            <p><character ref="william">William</character> muttered something under his breath
                which was not a blessing, and added aloud: <speech ref="william">You are better
                    here, sir, I think, at any rate. I'll be back in less than half an
                    hour.</speech></p>
            <p>Left to himself, young <character ref="grahamCoulton">Coulton</character> took off
                his coat, and shifting the settle a little, hung it over the end to dry. With his
                handkerchief he rubbed some of the wet out of his hair; then, perfectly exhausted,
                he lay down before the fire and, pillowing his head on his arm, fell fast
                asleep.</p>
            <p>He was awakened nearly an hour afterwards by the sound of someone gently stirring the
                fire and moving quietly about the room. Starting into a sitting posture, he looked
                around him, bewildered for a moment, and then, recognising his humble friend, said
                laughingly:</p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">I had lost myself; I could not imagine where I
                    was.</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="william">I am sorry to see you here, sir,</speech> was the reply;
                    <speech ref="william">but still this is better than being out of doors. It has
                    come on a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">nasty</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>. I brought a rug round with
                    me that, perhaps, you would wrap yourself in.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I wish, at the same time, you had brought me something to
                    eat,</speech> said the young man, laughing.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william">Are you hungry, then, sir?</speech> asked <character
                    ref="william">William</character>, in a tone of concern.</p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">Yes; I have had nothing to eat since breakfast. The
                    governor and I commenced rowing the minute we sat down to luncheon, and I rose
                    and left the table. But hunger does not signify; I am dry and warm, and can
                    forget the other matter in sleep.</speech>
            </p>
            <p><speech ref="william">And it's too late now to buy anything,</speech> soliloquised
                the man; <speech ref="william">the shops are all shut long ago. Do you think,
                    sir,</speech> he added, brightening, <speech ref="william">you could manage some
                    bread and cheese?</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Do I think—I should call it a perfect feast,</speech>

                    already.</speech></p>
            <p><character ref="william">William</character>'s only answer was to dart to the door
                and run downstairs. Presently he reappeared, carrying in one hand bread and cheese
                wrapped up in paper, and in the other a pewter measure full of beer.</p>
            <p><speech ref="william">It's the best I could do, sir,</speech> he said apologetically.
                    <speech ref="william">I had to beg this from the landlady.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Here's to her good health!</speech> exclaimed the young

                was now seated on the inverted basket, looking wistfully at the relish with which
                the son of the former master was eating his bread and cheese.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">No,</speech> was the decided answer. <speech

            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">But I am sure I am. My father always hated me, as he

                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">If you had heard what he said about her today, you might
                    find reason to alter your opinion. He told me I resembled her in mind as well as

            </p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="william">He did not mean it, sir.</speech>

        <chapter>
            <chapTitle>Chapter Two</chapTitle>
            <p>Lying on the settle, with the fire burnt out, and the room in total <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="1">darkness</scary_word>, <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                    >Graham Coulton</character> dreamed a curious dream. He thought he awoke from
                deep slumber to find a log smouldering away upon the hearth, and the mirror at the
                end of the apartment reflecting fitful gleams of light. He could not understand how
                it came to pass that, far away as he was from the glass, he was able to see
                everything in it; but he resigned himself to the difficulty without astonishment, as
                people generally do in dreams.</p>
            <plot point="haunting"/>
            <p>Neither did he feel surprised when he beheld the outline of a female figure seated
                beside the fire, engaged in picking something out of her lap and dropping it with a
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">despairing</scary_word> gesture.</p>
            <p>He heard the mellow sound of gold, and knew she was lifting and dropping sovereigns,
                he turned a little so as to see the person engaged in such a singular and
                meaningless manner, and found that, where there had been no chair on the previous
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0">night</scary_word>, there was a chair now, on
                which was seated an <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">old</scary_word>, <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="2">wrinkled</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">hag</scary_word>, her clothes poor and <scary_word

                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">scant</scary_word> white hair, her cheeks
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">sunken</scary_word>, her nose <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="2">hooked</scary_word>, her fingers more like <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="3">talons</scary_word> than aught else as they dived down into
                the heap of gold, portions of which they lifted but to scatter <scary_word pos="adv"

            <p>Out of the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">darkness</scary_word>—out of the corner
                of the room where the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">shadows</scary_word> lay
                deepest—out from the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">gloom</scary_word> abiding
                near the door—out from the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dreary</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">night</scary_word>, with their sodden feet and wet
                dripping from their heads, came the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">old</scary_word>
                men and the young children, the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">worn</scary_word>
                women and the weary hearts, whose misery that gold might have relieved, but whose
                wretchedness it mocked.</p>
            <p>Round that miser, who once sat gloating as she now sat lamenting, they crowded—all
                those <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">pale</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">sad</scary_word> shapes—the aged of days, the infant of hours, the
                sobbing outcast, honest poverty, repentant vice; but one low <scary_word pos="noun"
                    scale="3">cry</scary_word> proceeded from those <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                    >pale</scary_word> lips—a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">cry</scary_word> for
                help she might have given, but which she withheld.</p>
            <p>They closed about her, all together, as they had done singly in life; they prayed,
                they sobbed, they entreated; with <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                    >haggard</scary_word> eyes the figure regarded the poor she had repulsed, the
                children against whose <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">cry</scary_word> she had
                closed her ears, the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> people she had
                suffered to starve and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">die</scary_word> for want of
                what would have been the merest trifle to her; then, with a <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">terrible</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">scream</scary_word>, she raised her lean arms above
                her head, and sank down—down—the gold scattering as it fell out of her lap, and
                rolling along the floor, till its gleam was lost in the outer <scary_word pos="noun"
                    scale="2">darkness</scary_word> beyond.</p>
            <p>Then <character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character> awoke in good earnest,
                with the perspiration <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">oozing</scary_word> from
                every pore, with a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">fear</scary_word> and an
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">agony</scary_word> upon him such as he had
                never before felt in all his existence, and with the sound of the heart-rending
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">cry</scary_word>—<speech ref="missTynan">Oh! my
                    lost life</speech>—still ringing in his ears.</p>
            <p>Mingled with all, too, there seemed to have been some lesson for him which he had
                forgotten, that, try as he would, eluded his memory, and which, in the very act of
                waking, glided away.</p>
            <p>He lay for a little thinking about all this, and then, still heavy with sleep,
                retraced his way into dreamland once more.</p>
            <p>It was natural, perhaps, that, mingling with the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >strange</scary_word> fantasies which follow in the train of <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                    >darkness</scary_word>, the former vision should recur, and the young man ere
                long found himself toiling through scene after scene wherein the figure of the woman
                he had seen seated beside a dying fire held principal place.</p>
            <p>He saw her walking slowly across the floor munching a dry crust—she who could have
                purchased all the luxuries wealth can command; on the hearth, contemplating her,
                stood a man of commanding presence, dressed in the fashion of long ago. In his eyes
                there was a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">dark</scary_word> look of anger, on his
                lips a curling smile of disgust, and somehow, even in his sleep, the dreamer
                understood it was the ancestor to the descendant he beheld—that the house put to
                mean uses in which he lay had never so far descended from its high estate, as the
                woman possessed of so pitiful a soul, <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1"
                    >contaminated</scary_word> with the most <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >despicable</scary_word> and <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >insidious</scary_word> vice poor humanity knows, for all other vices seem to
                have connection with the flesh, but the greed of the miser eats into the very
                soul.</p>
            <p><scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">Filthy</scary_word> of person, <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">repulsive</scary_word> to look at, hard of heart as she was, he yet
                beheld another <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">phantom</scary_word>, which, coming
                into the room, met her almost on the threshold, taking her by the hand, and
                pleading, as it seemed, for assistance. He could not hear all that passed, but a
                word now and then fell upon his ear. Some talk of former days; some mention of a
                fair young mother—an appeal, as it seemed, to a time when they were tiny brother and
                sister, and the accursed greed for gold had not divided them. All in vain; the
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">hag</scary_word> only answered him as she had
                answered the children, and the young girls, and the <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >old</scary_word> people in his former vision. Her heart was as invulnerable to
                natural affection as it had proved to human sympathy. He begged, as it appeared, for
                aid to avert some bitter misfortune or <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1"
                    >terrible</scary_word> disgrace, and adamant might have been found more yielding
                to his prayer. Then the figure standing on the hearth changed to an angel, which
                folded its wings <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">mournfully</scary_word> over its
                face, and the man, with bowed head, slowly left the room.</p>
            <p>Even as he did so the scene changed again; it was <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                    >night</scary_word> once more, and the miser wended her way upstairs. From
                below, <character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character> fancied he watched
                her toiling wearily from step to step. She had aged <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2"
                    >strangely</scary_word> since the previous scenes. She moved with difficulty; it
                seemed the greatest exertion for her to <scary_word pos="verb" scale="3"
                    >creep</scary_word> from step to step, her skinny hand traversing the balusters
                with slow and painful deliberateness. Fascinated, the young man's eyes followed the
                progress of that feeble, decrepit woman. She was solitary in a <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">desolate</scary_word> house, with a deeper <scary_word pos="noun"
                    scale="2">blackness</scary_word> than the <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                    >darkness</scary_word> of <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>
                waiting to engulf her.</p>
            <p>It seemed to <character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character> that after
                that he lay for a time in a still, dreamless sleep, upon awaking from which he found
                himself entering a chamber as sordid and unclean in its appointments as the woman of
                his previous vision had been in her person. The poorest labourer's wife would have
                gathered more comforts around her than that room contained. A four-poster bedstead
                without hangings of any kind—a blind drawn up awry—an <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="0">old</scary_word> carpet covered with dust, and dirt on the floor—a
                rickety washstand with all the paint <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0"
                    >worn</scary_word> off it—an ancient mahogany dressing-table, and a <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="1">cracked</scary_word> glass spotted all over—were all the
                objects he could at first discern, looking at the room through that <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="1">dim</scary_word> light which oftentimes obtains in
                dreams.</p>
            <p>By degrees, however, he perceived the outline of someone lying huddled on the bed.
                Drawing nearer, he found it was that of the person whose <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">dreadful</scary_word> presence seemed to pervade the house. What a
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">terrible</scary_word> sight she looked, with her
                thin white locks scattered over the pillow, with what were mere remnants of blankets
                gathered about her shoulders, with her <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                    >claw-like</scary_word> fingers clutching the clothes, as though even in sleep
                she was guarding her gold!</p>
            <p>An <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">awful</scary_word> and a <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">repulsive</scary_word> spectacle, but not with half the <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="1">terror</scary_word> in it of that which followed. Even as

            <p><character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character> laughed, and answered:
                    <speech ref="grahamCoulton">Why, faith, I was somewhat in the case of Paddy,
                    “who could not slape for dhraming”. I slept well enough, I suppose, but whether
                    it was in consequence of the row with my dad, or the hard bed, or the

            <p><speech ref="william">Certainly, Master Graham. I have brought round a kettle, and I

                    supposed to have money. Whether she had or not, she was found dead from a stab
                    in her breast, and if there ever was any money, it must have been taken at the

            <p><speech ref="william">Yes, sir. She could not stand it any longer; she got that thin

                    she said she heard <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">footsteps</scary_word> and

                    ref="grahamCoulton">one may as well be picked off by a <scary_word pos="noun"
                        scale="1">ghost</scary_word> as a bullet. What is there to be afraid

            <p><character ref="william">William</character> only shook his head. He did not think

                gay than usual, and walked up the Lambeth road to the place where <character

            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">Don't croak, <character ref="william"
                    >William</character>,</speech> answered the young man; <speech

                    a Dutchman.</speech></p>
            <p>During the whole of that forenoon and afternoon, <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                    >Graham Coulton</character> searched diligently for the missing treasure
                    <character ref="mrTynan">Mr Tynan</character> assured him had never been
                discovered. Youth is confident and self- opinionated, and this fresh explorer felt
                satisfied that, though others had failed, he would be successful. On the second
                floor he found one door locked, but he did not pay much attention to that at the
                moment, as he believed if there was anything concealed it was more likely to be
                found in the lower than the upper part of the house. Late into the evening he
                pursued his researches in the kitchen and cellars and old-fashioned cupboards, of
                which the basement had an abundance.</p>
            <p>It was nearly eleven, when, engaged in poking about amongst the empty bins of a wine
                cellar as large as a family vault, he suddenly felt a<scary_phrase><scary_word
                        pos="noun" scale="2">rush</scary_word> of <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                        >cold</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">air</scary_word></scary_phrase> at his back.
                Moving, his candle was instantly extinguished, and in the very moment of being left
                in <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">darkness</scary_word> he saw, standing in the
                doorway, a woman, resembling her who had <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                    >haunted</scary_word> his dreams overnight.</p>
            <p>He rushed with outstretched hands to seize her, but clutched only
                    <scary_word>air</scary_word>. He relit his candle, and closely examined the
                basement, shutting off communication with the ground floor ere doing so. All in
                vain. Not a trace could he find of living creature—not a window was open—not a door
                unbolted.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">It is very odd,</speech> he thought, as, after securely
                fastening the door at the top of the staircase, he searched the whole upper portion
                of the house, with the exception of the one room mentioned.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I must get the key of that tomorrow,</speech> he decided,
                standing <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">gloomily</scary_word> with his back to the
                fire and his eyes <scary_word pos="verb" scale="0">wandering</scary_word> about the
                drawing-room, where he had once again taken up his abode.</p>
            <p>Even as the thought passed through his mind, he saw standing in the open doorway a
                woman with white <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dishevelled</scary_word> hair, clad
                in mean garments, <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">ragged</scary_word> and
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">dirty</scary_word>. She lifted her hand and
                shook it at him with a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3">menacing</scary_word>
                gesture, and then, just as he was darting towards her, a wonderful thing
                occurred.</p>
            <p>From behind the great mirror there glided a second female figure, at the sight of
                which the first turned and fled, littering <scary_word pos="adj" scale="3"
                    >piercing</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">shrieks</scary_word> as the other followed her from
                storey to storey.</p>
            <p>Sick almost with <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">terror</scary_word>, <character
                    ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character> watched the <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="3">dreadful</scary_word> pair as they fled upstairs past the locked room
                to the top of the house.</p>
            <p>It was a few minutes before he recovered his self-possession. When he did so, and
                searched the upper apartments, he found them totally empty.</p>
            <p>That <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>, ere lying down before the
                fire, he carefully locked and bolted the drawing-room door; before he did more he
                drew the heavy settle in front of it, so that if the lock were forced no entrance
                could be effected without considerable noise.</p>
            <p>For some time he lay awake, then dropped into a deep sleep, from which he was
                awakened suddenly by a noise as if of something scuffling <scary_word pos="adv"
                    scale="2">stealthily</scary_word> behind the wainscot. He raised himself on his
                elbow and listened, and, to his consternation, beheld seated at the opposite side of
                the hearth the same woman he had seen before in his dreams, lamenting over her
                gold.</p>
            <p>The fire was not quite out, and at that moment shot up a last tongue of flame. By the
                light, transient as it was, he saw that the figure pressed a <scary_word pos="adv"
                    scale="2">ghostly</scary_word> finger to its lips, and by the turn of its head
                and the attitude of its body seemed to be listening.</p>
            <p>He listened also—indeed, he was too much <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                    >frightened</scary_word> to do aught else; more and more distinct grew the
                sounds which had aroused him, a <scary_phrase><scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                        >stealthy</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">rustling</scary_word></scary_phrase> coming
                nearer and nearer—up and up it seemed, behind the wainscot.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">It is rats,</speech> thought the young man, though,
                indeed, his teeth were almost chattering in his head with <scary_word pos="noun"
                    scale="3">fear</scary_word>. But then in a moment he saw what disabused him of
                that idea—the gleam of a candle or lamp through a crack in the panelling. He tried
                to rise, he strove to shout—all in vain; and, sinking down, remembered nothing more
                till he awoke to find the grey light of an early morning stealing through one of the
                shutters he had left partially unclosed.</p>
            <p>For hours after his breakfast, which he scarcely touched, long after <character
                    ref="william">William</character> had left him at mid-day, <character
                    ref="grahamCoulton">Graham Coulton</character>, having in the morning made a
                long and close survey of the house, sat thinking before the fire, then, apparently
                having made up his mind, he put on the hat he had bought, and went out.</p>
            <p>When he returned the evening <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1">shadows</scary_word>
                were <scary_word pos="verb" scale="1">darkening</scary_word> down, but the pavements
                were full of people going marketing, for it was Christmas Eve, and all who had money
                to spend seemed bent on shopping.</p>
            <p>It was terribly <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">dreary</scary_word> inside the
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">old</scary_word> house that <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="1">night</scary_word>. Through the <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="1">deserted</scary_word> rooms <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                    >Graham</character> could feel that <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2"
                    >ghostly</scary_word> semblance was <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                    >wandering</scary_word>
                <scary_word pos="adv" scale="2">mournfully</scary_word>. When he turned his back he
                knew she was flitting from the mirror to the fire, from the fire to the mirror; but
                he was not afraid of her now—he was far more afraid of another matter he had taken
                in hand that day.</p>
            <p>The <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">horror</scary_word> of the <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="2">silent</scary_word> house grew and grew upon him. He could hear the
                beating of his own heart in the dead <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2"
                    >quietude</scary_word> which reigned from garret to cellar.</p>
            <p>At last <character ref="william">William</character> came; but the young man said
                nothing to him of what was in his mind. He talked to him cheerfully and hopefully
                enough—wondered where his father would think he had got to, and hoped <character
                    ref="mrTynan">Mr Tynan</character> might send him some Christmas pudding. Then
                the man said it was time for him to go, and, when <character ref="grahamCoulton">Mr
                    Coulton</character> went downstairs to the hall-door, remarked the key was not
                in it.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">No,</speech> was the answer, <speech>I took it out today,
                    to oil it.</speech></p>
            <p><speech ref="william">It wanted oiling,</speech> agreed <character ref="william"
                    >William</character>, <speech ref="william">for it worked terribly
                    stiff.</speech> Having uttered which truism he departed.</p>
            <p>Very slowly the young man retraced his way to the drawing-room, where he only paused
                to lock the door on the outside; then taking off his boots he went up to the top of
                the house, where, entering the front attic, he waited patiently in <scary_word
                    pos="noun" scale="1">darkness</scary_word> and in silence.</p>
            <p>It was a long time, or at least it seemed long to him, before he heard the same sound
                which had aroused him on the previous <scary_word pos="noun" scale="0"
                    >night</scary_word>—a <scary_phrase><scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                        >stealthy</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="3">rustling</scary_word></scary_phrase>—then
                        a<scary_phrase><scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">rush</scary_word> of
                        <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">cold</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">air</scary_word></scary_phrase>—then cautious
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">footsteps</scary_word>—then the quiet opening
                of a door below.</p>
            <p>It did not take as long in action as it has required to tell. In a moment the young
                man was out on the landing and had closed a portion of the panelling on the wall
                which stood open; noiselessly he crept back to the attic window, unlatched it, and
                sprung a rattle, the sound of which echoed far and near through the <scary_word
                    pos="adj" scale="1">deserted</scary_word> streets, then rushing down the stairs,
                he encountered a man who, darting past him, made for the landing above; but
                perceiving the way of escape closed, fled down again, to find <character
                    ref="grahamCoulton">Graham</character> struggling desperately with his
                fellow.</p>
            <p><speech>Give him the knife—come along,</speech> he said <scary_word pos="adv"
                    scale="3">savagely</scary_word>; and next instant <character ref="grahamCoulton"
                    >Graham</character>
                <scary_phrase>felt something like a <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2">hot</scary_word>
                    <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">iron</scary_word> through his
                    shoulder</scary_phrase>, and then heard a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="1"
                    >thud</scary_word>, as one of the men, tripping in his rapid flight, fell from
                the top of the stairs to the bottom.</p>
            <p>At the same moment there came a <scary_word pos="noun" scale="2">crash</scary_word>,
                as if the house was <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">falling</scary_word>, and
                    <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">faint</scary_word>, <scary_word pos="adj"
                    scale="1">sick</scary_word>, and <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2"
                    >bleeding</scary_word>, young <character ref="grahamCoulton">Coulton</character>
                lay <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">insensible</scary_word> on the threshold of the
                room where <character ref="missTynan">Miss Tynan</character> had been <scary_word
                    pos="verb" scale="3">murdered</scary_word>.</p>
            <p>When he recovered he was in the dining-room, and a doctor was examining his wound.
                Near the door a policeman stiffly kept guard. The hall was full of people; all the
                misery and vagabondism the streets contain at that hour was crowding in to see what
                had happened.</p>
            <p>Through the midst two men were being conveyed to the station-house; one, with his
                head <scary_word pos="adv" scale="1">dreadfully</scary_word> injured, on a
                stretcher, the other handcuffed, uttering <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                    >frightful</scary_word> imprecations as he went.</p>
            <p>After a time the house was cleared of the rabble, the police took possession of it,
                and <character ref="mrTynan">Mr Tynan</character> was sent for.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">What was that <scary_word pos="adj" scale="2"
                        >dreadful</scary_word> noise?</speech> asked Graham feebly, now seated on
                the floor, with his back resting against the wall.</p>
            <p><speech>I do not know. Was there a noise?</speech> said <character ref="mrTynan">Mr
                    Tynan</character>, humouring his fancy, as he thought.</p>
            <p>
                <speech ref="grahamCoulton">Yes, in the drawing-room, I think; the key is in my
                    pocket.</speech>
            </p>
            <p>Still humouring the wounded lad, <character ref="mrTynan">Mr Tynan</character> took
                the key and ran upstairs.</p>
            <p>When he unlocked the door, what a sight met his eyes! The mirror had <scary_word
                    pos="verb" scale="2">fallen</scary_word>—it was lying all over the floor
                    <scary_word pos="verb" scale="2">shivered</scary_word> into a thousand pieces;
                the console table had been borne down by its weight, and the marble slab was
                shattered as well. But this was not what chained his attention. Hundreds, thousands
                of gold pieces were scattered about, and an aperture behind the glass contained
                boxes filled with securities and deeds and bonds, the possession of which had cost
                his sister her life.</p>
            <p><speech ref="admiralCoulton">Well, <character ref="grahamCoulton">Graham</character>,
                    and what do you want?</speech> asked <character ref="admiralCoulton">Admiral
                    Coulton</character> that evening as his eldest born appeared before him, looking
                somewhat <scary_word pos="adj" scale="1">pale</scary_word> but otherwise
                unchanged.</p>
            <p><speech ref="grahamCoulton">I want nothing,</speech> was the answer, <speech
