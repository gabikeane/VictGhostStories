            <p> The “Victorian Ghost Stories” project arose out of our team leader, Gabi Keane’s,
                interest in supernatural Victorian literature garnered from <a
                    href="http://twyningvictorianenglitpitt.weebly.com">previous research</a>
                performed at the University of Pittsburgh. Our basic goal was to explore short ghost
                stories written by female English authors during the Victorian Era and uncover some
                unique insight or claim about how they used language to build suspense. While these
                stories were consumed mostly by middle class women, they were written by members of
                the upper class. We became curious as to what “scary words” were used to build
                suspense and how, if at all, the class or education level of the audience impacted
                the type of vocabulary these authors used to communicate. </p>
            <p> For our readings, we selected five short stories from four different authors:
                    <i>Walnut-Tree House</i> and <i>The Old House in Vauxhall Walk by Charlotte
                    Riddell</i>; <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i> by Elizabeth Gaskell; <i>The Shadow in
                    the Corner</i> by Mary Elizabeth Braddon; and <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i>
                by Edith Nesbitt. We chose multiple authors to measure for consistency across genre
                as opposed to one particular artist’s breadth of work.</p>
            <p> Stories by Charlotte Riddell and Elizabeth Gaskell were republished thanks to <a

                <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> by Edith Nesbitt was available for free via <a
                    href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>. <i>The Shadow in the
                    Corner</i> was republished with permission from <a

                like to extend a special thanks to our project overseer, Shannen Davis, as well as
                Professor David Birnbaum from the University of Pittsburgh for teaching us the
                tricks of the trade. </p>
