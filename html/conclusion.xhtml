            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <h3>Interpretation</h3> Except for <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i>, the “Haunting” section
            of each ghost story contains by far the largest amount of scary words per story. Both
                <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> and <i>The Shadow in the Corner</i> contain eight
            times the number of scary words in this section than in their introductions! Again, with
            the exception of <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i>, the remaining four follow a general
            trend, building gradual suspense between the “Introduction” and “Protagonist” sections,
            displaying climactic scary word clusters around “Haunting” and “History,” and then
            significantly tapering off the at the “Resolve.” This is almost identical to the
            traditional dramatic structure chart, but with different plot points, showing that these
            authors were aware of and implementing the literary norms in their own genre, despite
            its middle-class appeal.</div>
        <div class="w3-container"> In the “Number of Scary Words per Scariness Rating per Story”
            graph, we see that most stories contain mostly scary words rated 1 or 2 and relatively
            few intensifiers. Including 0 and intensifier ratings, <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i>
            contains the least amount of <i>possible</i> scary words at 93, while <i>Walnut-Tree
                House</i> contains the most with a whopping 583 possible scary words. The same holds
            for <i>true</i> scary words—words with scariness ratings of 1-3—with <i>John
                Charrington’s Wedding</i> coming in at 80 and <i>Walnut-Tree House</i> at 476.
                <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i> has 101 scale 3 scary words, making it the Victorian
            ghost story with the highest number of <i>scariest</i> words, while <i>John
                Charrington’s Wedding</i> again comes in last place with only 23. </div>
        <div class="w3-container"> The scariest type of words per story, according to part of
            speech, are nouns, with a combined total of 99 scale 3 words in all five ghost stories.
            The least scariest type of words are adverbs and modifiers, with combined totals of 4
            and 1 respectively. Adjectives were a close second for scariest word type, with a
            combined total of 90 scale 3 scary words, though we had originally suspected they would
            take the cake. The most action oriented ghost story was <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i>,
            with 26 scale 3 verbs, while the most passive was <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> with
            only 1. </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <h3>Richness of Expression of Scariness</h3> Based on our WordNet analysis and the
            resulting vocabulary richness ratios, the story with the greatest diversity in
            vocabulary is <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i>. We found this particularly interesting
            in light of the fact that <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> is the shortest of the ghost
            stories in our corpus. It is tempting to think that a longer story would include more
            variation in scary words, but there seems to be no direct correlation between the
            richness of the expression of scariness and the length of the story. The story with the
            lowest vocabulary richness ratio is <i>The Shadow in the Corner</i>, which is squarely
            in the middle in terms of length with respect to the other stories. </div>
        <div class="w3-container"> Our data indicates that lexical diversity in scary words is most
            likely a factor of literary choices on the part of the writer. For instance, the two
            ratios of vocabulary richness within the closest range of one another are those
            associated with <i>The Old House in Vauxhall Walk</i> and <i>Walnut-Tree House</i>, both
            written by Charlotte Riddell. Some authors are prone to repeating certain words, perhaps
            for emphatic effect, whereas other authors incorporate a wider range of chill-inducing
            vocabulary, engendering suspense by keeping the reader on their toes. </div>
        <div class="w3-container">
            <h3>Conclusion</h3> From our current data, we find that female authors writing Victorian
            ghost stories typically built suspense in two ways: (1) With a standardized plot
            structure; and (2) by using scary adjectives to describe scary nouns. In the Victorian
            ghost story plot, action gradually rises until the ghost appears, where it climaxes and
            then slowly dissolves as the protagonist finds some way to bring peace the situation.
            Despite the genre-specific tropes of "Haunting," "History," and "Protagonist," this more
            or less the pattern of most stories in the Western tradition. At a syntactic level, the
            norm seems to be to focus on the ghost or haunted house itself as the object of fear,
            increasing tension through describing its features and, to a lesser extent, by what the
            object actually does. This perhaps made the stories more accessible to middle-class
            readers, the authors relying more heavily on sensory, visceral details than deeply
            intellectual content. This does not imply that these stories were "dumbed down," but
            rather that they were meant to be more physically frightening, creating a sense of
            urgency and tangibility in the ethereal. </div>
        <div class="w3-container"> While it’s hard to declare objectively which of our five stories
            is indeed the scariest, we can make a few modest measurements. <i>Walnut-Tree House</i>
            has the highest number of scary words, but the words <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i> uses
            are <i>scarier</i>. <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> is by far the shortest text, but
            displays the greatest increase in scariness from its “Introduction” to “Haunting”
            sections relative to its size. Perhaps he’d like to step out of his grave and claim the
            prize? </div>
