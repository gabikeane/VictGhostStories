            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p> The “Victorian Ghost Stories” project attempts to answer the following research
                question: In what ways did female authors use language to build suspense in the
                Victorian ghost story? Our research topic involved the fields of literature,
                history, linguistics, and digital research methods. Our approach required textual
                analysis, XML language tools, and the WordNet lexical database. </p>
            <p> For our readings, we selected five short stories from four different authors:
                    <i>Walnut-Tree House</i> and <i>The Old House in Vauxhall Walk</i> by Charlotte
                Riddell; <i>The Old Nurse’s Story</i> by Elizabeth Gaskell; <i>The Shadow in the
                    Corner</i> by Mary Elizabeth Braddon; and <i>John Charrington’s Wedding</i> by
                Edith Nesbitt. This range generated enough data to compare contemporary texts with
                different writing styles without sacrificing our ability to perform in depth textual
                analysis on each individual story. Our model is applicable to larger samples of
                ghost stories, however, should future digital humanists desire to expound upon our
                research. </p>
            <h3>Markup and Analysis</h3>
            <p> After deciding upon our research question and selecting stories, we next performed a
                close read and analysis of each text to determine our methodology for markup. We
                decided that the focus of our exploration should be to find “scary words” and rate
                them according to <i>scariness</i>, <i>part of speech</i>, and <i>synset</i>, so
                that we could determine not only what scary language was used, but also in what ways
                its scariness and frequency affected the stories. We were able to model the
                structure of the stories using Relax NG, a schema language that limits XML markup to
                a certain heirarchy of elements.</p>
            <h3>Tracking "Scariness"</h3>
            <p>We compiled a list of 286 unique scary words that we then tagged in each text using
                XML markup. The scariness rating was determined by @scale attributes ranging from
                0-3, with the additional rating of “i” for intensifiers like “very” or “quite.”
                Scary words with a scale of 0 had the potential to ignite fear, but were not so used
                in context, like the words “black” or “cold.” These words could receive higher
                ratings when appropriate. Scary words with a scale of 3 were the scariest and
                therefore always scary, like “horror” or “deadly.” This was the most subjective part
                of the project, though we gave ourselves parameters in that we drew from an agreed
                upon list.</p>
            <p>Part of speech was measured with attribute @pos, with the available options of verb,
                noun, adjective, adverb, or modifier. We were curious about the way in which
                scariness was communicated, and this allowed us to see it at the grammar level. Is
                scariness more descriptive, such that the most frequent type of scary words are
                adjectives? Or is it more action based, such that they are verbs? This data
                influenced our conclusion, adding another level of specificity to our research
                question.</p>
            <h3>Interpreting our Data</h3>
            <p>Using an XML database created with eXistDB, we were able to extract data from all
                five stories, which we used to create tables and graphs. Our data has some flaws:
                for example, because different people tagged different stories, best judgement
                prevailed. Although we don't love that those variations exist, the structure of a
                semester long course necessitates some compromise. We acknowledge consistently in
                our conclusions and analysis that these issues exist, and hope this data functions
                more as a proof of concept than a conclusive analysis of the genre.</p>
            <h3>Wordnet</h3>
            <p>As one of our team members had a linguistics requirement to fill, we also explored
                our scary word elements using the WordNet lexical database. <a
                    href="https://wordnet.princeton.edu/">WordNet</a> is a hierarchical organization
                of units of meaning, called <i>synsets</i>, which are represented in texts by words.
                A detailed explanation of how synsets can be used to explore a text can be found <a
                    href="https://github.com/djbpitt/wordnet/blob/master/Wordnet.ipynb">here</a>.
                Our project in particular focused on task number three, “Exploring the richness of
                the expression of spookiness.” We concentrated the task on the “haunting” plot
                section of each ghost story, expecting that this specific section would incorporate
                the most significant amount of scary vocabulary. After tagging each scary word
                element in the haunting sections with its appropriate synset in context, we were
                able to examine the language that different writers and texts employ to represent
                scariness. A synset is best defined as a cluster of synonyms or meaning, We
                performed this linguistic investigation by dividing the number of distinct synsets
                by the number of scary words with a non-zero scariness rating. The resulting value
                for each text provides a ratio, for which a higher value indicates that scariness is
                expressed in a wider variety of morphological ways, whereas a lower value indicates
                less variety in vocabulary.</p>
